Since coming to Penn, I have survived my first winter and am learning to navigate the public transportation system. I am studying in the College of Arts and Sciences, where I plan to major in either Physics or International Relations, with a Hispanic Studies and Language minor. Joining the University of Pennsylvania’s International Affairs Association as an overwhelmed and confused freshman was one of the best decisions I have made since coming to Penn; I anticipate that ILMUNC India will be just as stimulating and enjoyable as the other Model United Nations conferences I have attended!</p>\r\n<p>I have enjoyed pursuing my passion for Model UN on the collegiate level through INTERCOL, Penn’s competitive travel team, and serving as one of the Under-Secretaries General for Crisis committees at UPMUNC. Not only have I improved my speaking and research skills, I have also met some of my best friends. I hope that we are able to foster a similar environment of learning and connection for all of you at ILMUNC India. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me or any other members on the Secretariat with questions or concerns. Get stoked for a dope conference!</p>','','','','Use of Mercenaries in Armed Conflict','The use of mercenaries and private security forces has become a common war tactic for developed nations. Military contractors are paid to execute actions which some nations may not be able to perform, legally or ethically. The United States, as well as a number of other large nations, have hired these private security forces to carry out war orders in conflict zones – most notably Iraq and Afghanistan. The use of these forces is a double-edged sword: mercenaries may carry out illegal, black-ops actions, but also keep national forces out of harm’s way. The international community must come to a resolution regarding these contracted organizations – whether they can be used at all, and if so, when?','Drone Proliferation','The proliferation of drones has become an incredibly pressing issue in the recent past. As technology continues to improve, more nations are hastening their drone programs. The United States is a notable example of such a country, maintaining a broad drone program that has expanded over the last eight years. With such expansion, however, has come financial, political, and ethical concerns. The financing of these programs, as well as their use to assassinate targets in foreign countries, strains diplomatic relations and calls into question the morality of drones themselves. Now, the international community must determine how and when drones should be used, and what international recourse (if any) should exist when a nation steps outside the bounds of legality.','','','','','','',1385,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'','',''),

Originally called the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, the IMO’s purpose is to maintain safe and secure shipping in international waters, as well as to monitor and prevent marine pollution. This agency plays an important role in “ensuring that lives at sea are not put at risk and that the marine environment is not polluted by shipping – as summed up in IMO’s mission statement: Safe, Secure and Efficient Shipping on Clean Oceans.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that the shipping industry remains one of the most cost effective methods of transportation of goods, at ILMUNC India 2017 the IMO is meeting to discuss an increasingly pertinent topic in international shipping: preventing pollution and the environmental degradation of oceans. This is a key issue in the pressing global discussion of environmental policies and involves the maintenance and safety of international waters via shipping regulations. Keeping in mind the United Nations Millennium Goals, the IMO at ILMUNC India 2017 must discuss, deliberate, and craft viable solutions to this topic to ensure the most efficient and least polluting standards for ships on global waters.</p>\r\n\r\n','','','','','','','','',1385,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'','',''),

The two Model United conferences were the Zonal Model United Nations conference and the National Model United Nations conference of my country, Mauritius. \r\nHaving little experience in public speaking at the time of selections for the Model United Nations conference at my college in February, I was hesitant to the proposals made by my former tutors to participate in the conference. The selection judged us on our orating and analytical skills and we had to criticize as well as provide concrete solutions to given topics. It turned out that I came first out of the lot for the selection stage as according to the jury panel and I had been the most fluent and better that my friends at explaining concepts. From that particular moment, I understood that this was what I loved doing and what I wanted to do, debating. \r\nSome weeks later, our 2 delegations had been assigned the countries that they were to represent respectively and I formed part in the delegation representing Sweden, the other one being Ivory Coast. Other than being acquainted to the other delegates in my delegation, there was not much synergy between us and we were behaving as complete strangers. After numerous training sessions presided by our mentors, (the former Model United Nations delegates of the previous year) the preparation for the Zonal Model United Nations conference taught me the value of friendship and forging bonds- they are invaluable. We started this journey together, worked hard day and had many sleepless nights to prepare ourselves for conference day and our mentors acknowledged us and were proud of all that what we had done- we came a long way since together.\r\nThe Zonal Model United Nations conference felt like a culminating point for me. The conference lasted 2 days and was the only time where I felt where we could show our worth and all our work. I had to read our country statement in the General assembly on day 1 and this was an all-new experience - to speak in front of more than five hundred persons who were all well dressed and attentively listening to every word I was saying. Every word I said in the microphone felt like it had weight and I had to be precise in my intonation for an even better delivery. What lasted for 90 seconds in the General Assembly, felt like forever, personally and I felt relieved after the country statement delivery had ended. I also felt that I had overcome my fears and the stage freight that I faced. \r\nWhen stepping into the Science and Technology commission room, I felt what was like an adrenaline rush. It was a desire to debate, to prove and defend our resolution and find flaws in other’s debate and solutions proposed- in the common goal of having plausible and feasible measures to address the world’s most pressing issues. I listened to every single delegate who came forward to debate and every time I had at least one question to ask on some point mentioned that was not specific. I conveyed both of my debates out loud and as clear as I could to captivate as much attention and to be easy to understand. Stepping out of the commission room on day two I had the conviction that I did my best out there and again it was a feeling of relief that I could go though both days together with my fellow delegates and all went well.\r\nThe proclamation was done with best delegates first and then best delegations. I was proclaimed best delegate of the Science and Technology commission but I had mixed feelings- I felt a sense of accomplishment that my hard work paid off but at the same time I felt that this award will not be worthy of being won if both our delegations were proclaimed best delegations. Then my delegation was announced best delegation and we went on stage, but still the delegation of Ivory Coast was missing. During that tense moment, all Sweden delegates were holding hands hoping that all of us together WE WIN. I really cherish that moment and it was a very emotional moment for all of us, barely saying a word to each other but understanding everyone. We had developed such a deep connection among ourselves; we could express and tell what the other was feeling and thinking with facial expressions and body language only and words.\r\nMoving on to the National Model United Nations conference, it was again the same feeling that only that special conference can give. This time around I was assigned to be a delegate representing Saudi Arabia in the Political commission, the other delegation from my school representing Angola.  Even more persons to talk in front of and the conference becomes more challenging. National Model United Nations conference had the best students in the country. Together we worked even harder and this time, my co-delegates put me as the head of delegation to coordinate our work even more efficiently. That greatly improved my leadership and management skills. \r\nPolitical commission for the National Model United Nations, had no equal flooring to the point where, only a few delegates could express themselves fully. I was given the floor for two debates and had only 1 point of information allowed compared to the other delegates who got 3 points of information minimum. Moreover, the chairpersons were biased towards some delegates and rejected point of orders when they were right, few rights of reply were entertained even though many false accusations were made, only to mention a few!  A heavy atmosphere, of frustration, could be felt in the commission room. At the time of proclamation, neither Saudi Arabia nor Angola were proclaimed best delegates and we left the General Assembly with heavy hearts. We discussed what happened in each of our respective commission rooms and cheered up each other together with that misery laugh. Proclamation was over, the National Model United Nations conference was over and we accepted all of it and I feel like this is the best scenario that could have happened. One of the chairpersons said,” you do not have to be proclaimed winners to be winners.” At first, I thought those were words were blunt and were meant to console some sorrowful minds, but reflecting upon those words taught me that life was not only about winning. \r\n I can say that I have had the complete package of the Model United Nations conference with the good and the bad. At the end of the day though, I forged strong bonds with my friends (whom I shall call brothers), I learned so many things about the United Nations and its role in dealing with all the scourges that our world faces today, improved my orating skills,  I was taught to accept things and that they do not always happen as expected no matter how much effort is done, I learned how cruel our world really is out there and most importantly that winning does not mean everything- you are the real winner only when everyone acknowledges that you are the best, and it is only when you work hard and give your best that you are happy.\r\nI am thankful to every single person stood with me in the beginning of this journey. Participating in the Model United Nations conference has made be grown much. Every experience I got was enriching in one way or the other and I firmly believe that the Model United Nations conferences will forge our future leaders.','United Kingdom','Russia','Japan','France','China','SaudiArabia',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Hailing from the capital of the World\'s Largest Democracy, I have been a citizen of a country which had metamorphosed from slave-country to one of the most superlative countries of the world. Living in such a diverse country with more than 22 languages, has given me an example of differences between us, humans. The need to put our differences and work towards mutual goals is the need of the hour, as only together, only through change, can we as species truly live.\r\nI\'ve been MUNing since almost a year. Debating, for me, has been an activity which is complete personality, as well as intellect builder. Being a former introvert, the spark ignited in me through debating gave me the power to have an opinion on any topic. An opinion, an idea, is the genesis of change.  From the experience of my very first MUN, I knew that this was an activity, or rather, an art, which I would pursue further. \r\n\r\nSince then,  I\'ve been a part of 15 Model UN conferences as a delegate, three of them being of an International Level. I\'m also a part of the secretariat of an upcoming conference, holding the post- USG Content Development.\r\nI hope it is taken into consideration that I was selected for the AD Online Interview for this conference as well. \r\n\r\nThe following is a tentative list of my Model UN experience:\r\n\r\nI.

Mexico&rsquo;s highest court has allowed some citizens to grow cannabis for personal use. Colombia has reversed its decades-long policy of aerial spraying against coca, the raw ingredient in cocaine.</p>\n<p>Even in the United States, once the chief architect of the global war on drugs, four states permit recreational marijuana sales. Other states have pro-legalization ballot measures pending. And a heroin epidemic has prompted the mayor of at least one city to propose establishing a supervised injection clinic.</p>\n<p>It is not as if the United Nations snack bar is going to start selling pot-laced gummy bears anytime soon. Still, a growing worldwide insurgency is confronting the war on drugs, with public health workers, the police andlawmakers questioning the wisdom of decades-old global conventionsmeant to eradicate illegal substances and punish those who produce and consume them.</p>\n<p>That fight will preoccupy the United Nations General Assembly this week, as world leaders debate whether punitive international drug laws should be eased to reflect the times. It is the first time in nearly two decades that countries will debate longstanding drug laws.</p>\n<p>That debate comes at a time when countries large and small are rethinking their approaches to the drug issue, adopting policies that experts say breach current global conventions against drugs by legalizing some substances in some places &mdash; and lessening punishment for offenders in others.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are on the cusp of the collapse of the regime,&rdquo; said Vanda Felbab-Brown, an analyst at the Brookings Institution.</p>\n<p>The conflict pits two equally improbable alliances against each other. On one side are the insurgents, led largely by several countries in Latin America that have begun to challenge conventional antidrug strategies or to legalize some drugs in hopes of blunting the violence that the drug wars have wrought. Canada&rsquo;s health minister will make her country&rsquo;s pitch to legalize marijuana, along with the presidents of Bolivia and Colombia, critics of the existing treaties.</p>\n<p>On the other side are the staunch defenders of those conventions.</p>\n<p>They are led by Russia and China, and they are joined by smaller countries with some of the strictest drug laws, including those that impose the death penalty, such as Singapore, Iran and Saudi Arabia. A push to prohibit the death penalty in drug cases is expected to be one of the most contentious items in the discussions this week.</p>\n<p>The United States, once the world&rsquo;s principal drug-law enforcer, is in the most awkward spot. It opposes overturning the relevant global treaties (there are three, the first dating to 1961). But it has also been put on notice for violating those treaties with initiatives that legalized recreational cannabis use in four states. That makes it hard for American officials to scold other countries for taking a less-than-prohibitionist stance against drugs.</p>\n<p>William R. Brownfield, the top State Department official in charge of combating drug-trafficking, sought to strike a balance when he told reporters last month that the United States would, in effect, not oppose how other governments choose to deal with drug laws within their own borders. American officials have also argued that because federal law continues to prohibit recreational use of marijuana, it is therefore not afoul of the global drug treaties.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My view &mdash; my government&rsquo;s view &mdash; is let&rsquo;s establish some basic pillars: Defend the integrity of the conventions, accept the inherent discretion within those conventions, tolerance for governments exploring their own national policies, and a commitment to combating the transnational criminal organizations,&rdquo; Mr. Brownfield said.</p>\n<p>For years, international drug laws have been geared toward eliminating illegal substances &mdash; in 1998, the last time the United Nations took up the subject, a declaration stressed that the consumption of illicit drugs &ldquo;must not become accepted as a way of life&rdquo; &mdash; and to punish those who produce and use them.</p>\n<p>That approach has since come under sharp scrutiny, not just in public health and human rights quarters, but, increasingly, from law enforcement authorities and politicians who suggest it may have done more harm than good.</p>\n<p>In the United States, the Obama administration has taken steps toward addressing what it considers unduly harsh prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. Such sentences have also become an issue in this year&rsquo;s American presidential race.</p>\n<p>The three-day review of drug laws at the United Nations this week is expected to yield much less than reformers hope.</p>\n<p>The drug treaties are not likely to be abrogated or renegotiated, largely because of the influence of countries like Russia (one of whose career diplomats runs the United Nations drugs office) and Egypt (one of whose envoys will lead this week&rsquo;s General Assembly Special Session).</p>\n<p>The meeting does, however, highlight how divided the world has become over the right approach to drug laws.</p>\n<p>Inside the General Assembly hall, countries are expected to endorse a document, completed after weeks of negotiations, that reaffirms the commitment to &ldquo;promote a society free of drug abuse,&rdquo; but also acknowledges public health concerns and recognizes &ldquo;alternative or additional measures&rdquo; to punishment. The document makes no mention of decriminalization.</p>\n<p>Bernie Sanders, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, was moved to weigh in on the topic. Last week, he was among hundreds of people, and one of six senators, who signed an open letter to the United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon. The war on drugs had proved &ldquo;disastrous for global health, security and human rights,&rdquo; stated the letter, which expressed support for state and national governments around the world that had legalized marijuana.</p>\n<p>The letter was endorsed by an unlikely alliance of politicians, business leaders and activists, including the billionaire investor Warren Buffett; the founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, Alicia Garza; Ernesto Zedillo, a former president of Mexico; and the musician Sting.</p>'),

Legalization for medical use will also be on the ballot in Florida, Missouri and Arkansas on that same day.</p>\n<p>\"This is really a watershed year for marijuana legalization, so I\'m hoping that we\'ll see some big changes in November,\" said F. Aaron Smith, co-founder and executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association.</p>\n<p>Smith said he\'s \"especially excited\" about California. It\'s the most populous state in the country and the sixth largest economy in the world, surpassing France.</p>\n<p>\"California really is the linchpin for hemispheral legalization,\" said St. Pierre of NORML, hoping that a green light in California could trigger a snowball of legalization throughout the country.</p>\n<p>California Secretary of State Alex Padilla confirmed on Tuesday that the legalization initiative exceeded the 402,468 signatures required to put the issue on the ballot.</p>\n<p>If the initiative is approved by voters, it would impose a 15% sales tax on retail sales of pot with additional taxes on the growers.</p>\n<p>The supporters of the initiative, like Dale Gieringer of the California chapter of NORML, say this could raise more than $1 billion in annual tax revenue and estimate that law enforcement costs could be reduced by at least $100 million. This is based on the assumption that retail sales would be at least $7 billion a year.</p>\n<p>Related: Cotton candy, tooth picks, pet gel: all products made from marijuana</p>\n<p>But tax revenue estimates for legalized pot tend to vary widely, are not always reliable. When the voters of Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, the state estimated that tax revenue from retail special sales could total $70 million during the first full fiscal year of dispensary sales. But in that time period, July 2014 to June 2015, the state actually brought in $42 million in retail special sales tax.</p>\n<p>Medical marijuana is already legal in California, which was the first state to legalize it in 1996. But despite California\'s weed-friendly reputation, there\'s no guarantee voters will pass another legalization law.</p>\n<p>Prop 19, a ballot item to legalize recreation marijuana, went before California voters in 2010 but failed to pass. Prop 19 would have created a legal patchwork across the state, where individual cities and districts would decide whether it was legal or not in their particular places.</p>\n<p>Billionaire philanthropist George Soros supported it, but former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called it a \"flawed initiative that would bring about a host of legal nightmares and risks to public safety.\"</p>\n<p>Since then, the voters of four states, including Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, and also Washington, DC, have legalized marijuana for recreational use.</p>\n<p>Related: Eight things to know about legal pot</p>\n<p>Medical marijuana is even more widespread. It\'s fully legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia, according to NORML, and 18 other states have partial legality, or have passed laws that haven\'t gone into effect yet.</p>\n<p>But marijuana is still illegal in the eyes of the federal government, which means it cannot be transported between legal states, even those that border each other, like Oregon and Washington.</p>\n<p>More importantly, from a business standpoint, banks refuse to handle finances from marijuana businesses to avoid running afoul of federal banking laws. So some dispensaries only deal in cash.</p>'),

The campaign that we are launching today, \'Listen First\', seeks to build on these successes and raise awareness of the fact that drug use prevention based on science is an effective investment in the wellbeing of our children and youth, families and communities.

By about 8 p.m., the emperor of France knew he had been decisively defeated at a village called Waterloo, and he was now keen to escape from his enemies, some of whom&mdash;such as the Prussians&mdash;had sworn to execute him.</p>\n<p>Less than an hour earlier, Napoleon had sent eight battalions of his elite Imperial Guard into the attack up the main Charleroi-to-Brussels road in a desperate attempt to break the line of the Anglo-Allied army commanded by the Duke of Wellington. But Wellington had repulsed the assault with a massive concentration of firepower. \"Bullets and grapeshot left the road strewn with dead and wounded,\" recalled a French eyewitness. The guard stopped, staggered and fell back. A shocked&mdash;indeed, astounded&mdash;cry went up from the rest of the French Army, one unheard on any European battlefield in the unit\'s 16-year history: \"<em>La Garde recule!</em>\" (\"The Guard recoils!\")</p>\n<p>The next cry spelled disaster for any hopes Napoleon might have had for an orderly retreat: \"<em>Sauve qui peut!</em>\" (\"Save yourselves!\"). Across the three-mile battlefront men threw down their muskets and fled, terrified of the Prussian lancers who were being ordered to pursue them with their eight-foot spears. In mid-June, darkness would not descend on that part of Europe for hours. Soon general panic set in.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The whole army was in the most appalling disorder,&rdquo; recalled Gen. Jean-Martin Petit. &ldquo;Infantry, cavalry, artillery&mdash;everybody was fleeing in all directions.&rdquo; Napoleon had ordered two squares of the Imperial Guard to form up on both sides of the highway to cover such a rout, and he took refuge within one of them as his army collapsed. &ldquo;The enemy was close at our heels,&rdquo; wrote Petit, who commanded the squares, &ldquo;and, fearing that he might penetrate the squares, we were obliged to fire at the men who were being pursued.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Taking a few trusted aides with him, as well as a squadron of light cavalry for personal protection, Napoleon left the square on horseback for the farmhouse at Le Caillou where he had breakfasted that morning, full of hopes for victory. There he transferred into his carriage. In the crush of fugitives on the road outside the town of Genappe he had to abandon it for a horse once again, although there were so many people that he could hardly go at much more than a walking pace.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Of personal fear there was not the slightest trace,&rdquo; one of Napoleon&rsquo;s entourage, the Comte de Flahaut, wrote later. But the emperor was &ldquo;so overcome by fatigue and the exertion of the preceding days that several times he was unable to resist the sleepiness which overcame him, and if I had not been there to uphold him, he would have fallen from his horse.&rdquo; By 5 a.m. on June 19 they stopped by a fire some soldiers had made in a meadow. As Napoleon warmed himself he said to one of his generals, &ldquo;<em>Eh bien, monsieur, </em>we have done a fine thing.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a sign of his extraordinary sangfroid that even then, he was able to joke, however glumly.</p>\n<p>There was no denying that the Battle of Waterloo had been catastrophic. Except for the Battle of Borodino, which Napoleon had fought in Russia in his disastrous 1812 campaign, this was the costliest single day of the 23 years of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Between 25,000 and 31,000 Frenchmen were killed or wounded, and vast numbers more were captured. Of Napoleon&rsquo;s 64 most senior generals, no fewer than 26 were casualties. The losses for the Allies were severe, too&mdash;Wellington lost 17,200 men, the Prussian commander Marshal Gebhard von Bl&uuml;cher a further 7,000. Within a month, the disaster cost Napoleon his throne.</p>\n<p>Walking the battlefield today, it&rsquo;s all too easy to understand why he lost. From the 140-foot-high Lion&rsquo;s Mound, which was built in the 1820s on top of Wellington&rsquo;s front line, one can see what Napoleon could not: the woods to the east from which 50,000 Prussians started to emerge at 1 p.m. to stave in the French right flank, plus the two stone farmhouses of La Haie Sainte and Hougoumont, which disrupted and funneled the French attack for most of the day.</p>\n<p>A vast amount of literature has explored why Napoleon fought such an unimaginative, error-prone battle at Waterloo. Hundreds of thousands of historians have pored over the questions of why he attacked when, where and how he attacked. Yet 200 years after the fact, a different question must be asked: Why was the Battle of Waterloo even fought? Was it really necessary to secure the peace and security of Europe?</p>\n<p>**********</p>\n<p>The future emperor of the French didn&rsquo;t learn to speak their language until he was sent to boarding school at the age of 9. It was not his second language, but his third. Napoleone di Buonaparte was born on August 15, 1769, on the island of Corsica; for centuries a backwater province of Genoa, it had been sold to the French the previous year. He grew up speaking the <em>corsicano</em> dialect and Italian, and his name was Gaulified to Napoleon Bonaparte as he and his family painfully accommodated themselves to French rule. In fact, he was extremely anti-French until the age of 20, going through a period of adolescent angst in which he identified them as the enemy of his beloved freedom-loving Corsica.</p>\n<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s charming but indolent father, Carlo, died of cancer when Napoleon was only 15; the schoolboy had to mature early to help take care of his nearly bankrupt family. Yet at the military academy at Brienne he still had time to read and reread Goethe&rsquo;s romantic novel <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em>, identifying with its honest but tragic hero. He later wrote his own melodramatic novel, <em>Clisson and Eug&eacute;nie</em>, whose protagonist is a brilliant soldier crossed in love by a gorgeous but faithless beauty, clearly based on Eug&eacute;nie D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Clary, a girlfriend who had recently refused his offer of marriage.</p>\n<p>His antipathy for the French notwithstanding, the youthful Napoleon primarily identified with the Enlightenment and the dreams of Rousseau and Voltaire. That both were forced into exile by the French State only increased their appeal for him, as did their praise for the Corsican experiment that had been snuffed out the year before Napoleon was born. He also drew inspiration from the American Revolutionaries, who finally triumphed when Napoleon was an impressionable 14. (After George Washington died, in 1799, the recently installed French leader ordered that his nation go into ten days of mourning, compared with a mere two days after his first wife, the empress Jos&eacute;phine, died 15 years later.) The French Revolution broke out with the fall of the Bastille when Napoleon was nearly 20; he eagerly embraced the Enlightenment ideas it at least initially represented.</p>\n<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s years at Brienne and then at the &Eacute;cole Militaire in Paris (near where the Eiffel Tower is today) taught him the essence of modern warcraft. He put that knowledge to invaluable use in defense of the Revolution at the Battle of Toulon in 1793, which won him promotion to a generalship at the age of 24. Overall, he would win no fewer than 48 of the 60 battles he fought, drawing five and losing only seven (three of which were comparatively minor), establishing him as one of the greatest military commanders of all time.</p>\n<p>Yet he said he would be remembered not for his military victories, but for his domestic reforms, especially the Code Napoleon, that brilliant distillation of 42 competing and often contradictory legal codes into a single, easily comprehensible body of French law. In fact, Napoleon&rsquo;s years as first consul, from 1799 to 1804, were extraordinarily peaceful and productive. He also created the educational system based on <em>lyc&eacute;es</em> and <em>grandes &eacute;coles</em> and the Sorbonne, which put France at the forefront of European educational achievement. He consolidated the administrative system based on departments and prefects. He initiated the Council of State, which still vets the laws of France, and the Court of Audit, which oversees its public accounts. He organized the Banque de France and the L&eacute;gion d&rsquo;Honneur, which thrive today. He also built or renovated much of the Parisian architecture that we still enjoy, both the useful&mdash;the quays along the Seine and four bridges over it, the sewers and reservoirs&mdash;and the beautiful, such as the Arc de Triomphe, the Rue de Rivoli and the Vend&ocirc;me column.</p>\n<p>Not least, Napoleon negotiated the 1803 sale to the nascent United States of the vast territory called the Louisiana Purchase. Americans are familiar with their side of the deal: It doubled their territory overnight at less than four cents an acre and instantly established the country &ldquo;among the powers of first rank,&rdquo; as Robert R. Livingston, President Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s chief negotiator, put it. But the French averted war with the United States over its inevitable expansion westward, and the 80 million francs they received allowed Napoleon to rebuild France, especially its army.</p>\n<p>Napoleon crowned himself emperor on December 2, 1804, turning the French Republic into the French Empire, with a Bonaparte line of succession. He felt that this provision for continuity was prudent, given that the Bourbons launched a series of assassination attempts on him&mdash;30 in all. Yet this return to monarchy did not alleviate the ancien r&eacute;gime powers&rsquo; rancor over the French occupation of lands in Germany and Italy that had belonged to Austria for decades. In September 1805, Austria invaded Napoleon&rsquo;s ally Bavaria, and Russia declared war on France as well. Napoleon swiftly won the ensuing War of the Third Coalition with his finest victory, at Austerlitz in 1805. The next year the Prussians also declared war on him, but they were soundly defeated at Jena; Napoleon&rsquo;s peace treaty of Tilsit with Russia and Prussia followed. The Austrians declared war on France once more in 1809, but were dispatched at the Battle of Wagram and signed yet another peace treaty.</p>\n<p>Napoleon started none of those wars, but he won all of them. After 1809 there was an uneasy peace with the three other Continental powers, but in 1812 he responded to France&rsquo;s being cut out of Russian markets&mdash;in violation of the Tilsit terms&mdash;by invading Russia. That ended in the catastrophic retreat from Moscow, which cost him more than half a million casualties and left his Grande Arm&eacute;e too vitiated to deter Austria and Prussia from joining his enemies Russia and Britain in 1813.</p>\n<p>**********</p>\n<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s relationship with Jos&eacute;phine was not the Romeo-and-Juliet story often told. Shortly before their marriage, in March 1796, he was appointed commander in chief of the Army of Italy, where he won an astonishing series of more than a dozen victories against Austria, the papacy and local states, all the while writing her scores of erotic, emotionally needy love letters, even while under enemy fire. But within weeks his bride took a lover in Paris&mdash;the dandyish cavalry officer Lt. Hippolyte Charles, whom one of their contemporaries said &ldquo;had the elegance of a wigmaker&rsquo;s boy.&rdquo; When Napoleon finally found out about the affair two years later, he was in the middle of the Egyptian desert, on his way to Cairo. He responded by bedding Pauline Four&egrave;s, the wife of one of his junior officers&mdash;the first of no fewer than 22 mistresses over the next 17 years.</p>\n<p>When he returned to Paris a year later, Napoleon unexpectedly forgave Jos&eacute;phine, and they created what amounted&mdash;his mistresses excepted&mdash;to a loving bourgeois family environment in which to raise Jos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s children by an earlier marriage at their palaces of Malmaison, Fontainebleau, the Tuileries and elsewhere. It was only in 1809, when it had become clear that Jos&eacute;phine could not bear the son Napoleon needed to continue the Bonaparte dynasty, that he reluctantly divorced her and the next year married the Archduchess Marie Louise von Habsburg, the daughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria. She quickly bore a son, the king of Rome.</p>\n<p>Napoleon later said he greatly regretted not marrying instead the sister of Czar Alexander I of Russia, believing&mdash;probably wrongly&mdash;that he would not have had to invade Russia in 1812. In any event, after he retreated from Moscow, the Continental powers and the British pursued his army into France. The emperor&rsquo;s military skill was intact&mdash;he won four victories in five days in the Champagne region in February 1814&mdash;but he could not prevent his boyhood friend and longtime comrade in arms Marshal Auguste de Marmont from surrendering Paris to the Austrians, Prussians and Russians the next month. Napoleon abdicated rather than plunge France into a civil war. He was exiled to the tiny Mediterranean island of Elba in May.</p>\n<p>That month Louis XVIII, the head of the Bourbon family, returned to France &ldquo;in the baggage train of the Allies,&rdquo; as the contemptuous but essentially accurate Bonapartist phrase put it. The Bourbons began ruling in France for the first time since Louis&rsquo; elder brother Louis XVI and his sister-in-law Marie Antoinette had been guillotined some 21 years earlier. As Napoleon adjusted to life ruling a much-reduced domain, he kept a close eye on what was happening in France.</p>\n<p>It was said of the Bourbons that they &ldquo;had learned nothing and forgotten nothing&rdquo; when they returned to power. They had not learned from the French Revolution and Napoleonic Empire that the French people had changed profoundly and now took for granted meritocracy, low direct taxation, secular education and a certain degree of military glory. Nor had the Bourbons forgotten the expropriations and executions suffered by the royal family, the aristocracy and the Catholic Church during the Reign of Terror in the 1790s. As a result, they returned to France ill-prepared to effect a grand settlement that could reconcile the contesting demands of the army, clergy, aristocracy, peasantry, merchants, Bonapartists, liberals, ex-revolutionaries and conservatives.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the task was impossible, but after nine months it became clear, even on distant Elba, that Louis XVIII had failed. Napoleon was emboldened to take the last and greatest gamble of his life.</p>\n<p>On February 26, 1815, he secretly boarded the largest ship in his tiny fleet and sailed to Golfe-Juan, on the south coast of France. The British and Bourbon frigates in the area didn&rsquo;t learn of his escape until it was too late. Landing on March 1, Napoleon struck north with the 600 Imperial Guardsmen he had brought with him, over mountain passes and through tiny villages, sometimes on foot when the paths were too steep and narrow to ride down. The route he took from Cannes to Grenoble&mdash;today mapped out as the Route Napoleon for tourists, hikers and cyclists&mdash;is one of the loveliest (if more vertiginous) trails in the country.</p>\n<p>Of course Louis XVIII sent armies to arrest him. But the commanders, Marshals Nicolas Soult and Michel Ney, and their men switched sides the moment they came into contact with the charisma of their former sovereign. On March 20, Napoleon reached the Tuileries Palace in Paris&mdash;on the site of the Louvre today&mdash;and was acclaimed by the populace. Col. L&eacute;on-Michel Routier, who was chatting with fellow officers nearby, recalled: &ldquo;Suddenly very simple carriages without any escort showed up at the wicket-gate by the river and the emperor was announced....The carriages enter, we all rush around them and we see Napoleon get out. Then everyone&rsquo;s in delirium; we jump on him in disorder, we surround him, we squeeze him, we almost suffocate him.&rdquo; It was a &ldquo;magical arrival, the result of a road of over two hundred leagues traveled in eighteen days on French soil without spilling one drop of blood.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That night Napoleon sat down to eat the dinner that had been cooked for Louis XVIII, who had fled Paris only hours earlier. Not one shot had been fired in the Bourbons&rsquo; defense. &ldquo;Never before in history,&rdquo; said Parisian wags, &ldquo;has an emperor won an empire simply by showing his hat.&rdquo; (Napoleon&rsquo;s bicorn hat had long been one of his many instantly recognizable symbols. This past November, one of his hats was auctioned to a South Korean businessman for $2.4 million.)</p>\n<p>The Allies reacted with shocked disbelief. They were gathered at a congress in Vienna when news of his escape reached them on March 7, but initially the representatives of Austria, Russia, Britain and Prussia had no idea where he had gone. Once they established four days later that Napoleon had returned to France, they issued what has been called the Vienna Declaration: &ldquo;By appearing again in France with projects of confusion and disorder, he has deprived himself of the protection of the law and has manifested before the world that there can be neither peace nor truce with him. The Powers consequently declare that Napoleon Bonaparte has placed himself beyond the pale of civil and social relations, and that as an enemy and disturber of the tranquility of the world, he has delivered himself up to public vengeance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This language, which seems extremely tough to modern ears, was a compromise from a draft offered by the French government, &ldquo;which virtually called Napoleon a wild beast and invited any peasant lad or maniac to shoot him down at sight,&rdquo; as the historian Enno E. Kraehe later put it. The Austrian chancellor, Prince Klemens von Metternich, softened the wording because Napoleon was still the son-in-law of the emperor of Austria, and the Duke of Wellington denounced the language as encouraging the assassination of monarchs. Nonetheless, the declaration clearly foreclosed any negotiation.</p>\n<p>On April 4 Napoleon wrote to the Allies, &ldquo;After presenting the spectacle of great campaigns to the world, from now on it will be more pleasant to know no other rivalry than that of the benefits of peace, of no other struggle than the holy conflict of the happiness of peoples.&rdquo; By then the Allies had already formed the Seventh Coalition to destroy him and restore the Bourbons to the French throne, in defiance of the wishes the French people had expressed in a referendum. Thus they made the Waterloo campaign as inevitable as it was ultimately unnecessary.</p>\n<p>**********</p>\n<p>The foremost motive that the British, Austrians, Prussians, Russians and lesser powers publicly gave for declaring war was that Napoleon couldn&rsquo;t be trusted to keep the peace. As one British member of Parliament put it, peace &ldquo;must always be uncertain with such a man, and...whilst he reigns, would require a constant armament, and hostile preparations more intolerable than war itself.&rdquo; That may have been true during his imperial period, but this time around Napoleon&rsquo;s behavior suggested that the Allies could have taken him at his word.</p>\n<p>He told his council that he had renounced any dream of reconstituting the empire and that &ldquo;henceforth the happiness and the consolidation&rdquo; of France &ldquo;shall be the object of all my thoughts.&rdquo; He refrained from taking measures against anyone who had betrayed him the previous year. &ldquo;Of all that individuals have done, written or said since the taking of Paris,&rdquo; he proclaimed, &ldquo;I shall forever remain ignorant.&rdquo; He immediately set about instituting a new liberal constitution incorporating trial by jury, freedom of speech and a bicameral legislature that curtailed some of his own powers; it was written by the former opposition politician Benjamin Constant, whom he had once sent into internal exile.</p>\n<p>Napoleon well knew that after 23 years of almost constant war, the French people wanted no more of it. His greatest hope was for a peaceful period like his days as first consul, in which he could re-establish the legitimacy of his dynasty, return the nation&rsquo;s battered economy to strength and restore the civil order the Bourbons had disturbed.</p>\n<p>And so he resumed building various public works in Paris, including the elephant fountain at the Bastille, a new marketplace at St. Germain, the foreign ministry at the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay, and the Louvre. He sent the actor Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph Talma to teach at the Conservatory, which the Bourbons had closed, and also returned to their government jobs Vivant Denon, the director of the Louvre; the painter Jacques-Louis David; the architect Pierre Fontaine; and the doctor Jean-Nicolas Corvisart. On March 31, he visited the orphaned daughters of members of the L&eacute;gion d&rsquo;Honneur, whose school at Saint-Denis had had its funding cut by the Bourbons. That same day he restored the University of France to its former footing, appointing the Comte de Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de as chancellor. At a concert at the Tuileries he kindled a romance with the celebrated 36-year-old actress and beauty Anne Hippolyte Boutet Salvetat (whose stage name was Mademoiselle Mars).</p>\n<p>All that Napoleon achieved in just 12 weeks after he returned to Paris&mdash;even as he prepared for the war the Allies had declared on him.</p>\n<p>Like the Bourbons, they were in no mood to forgive or forget. In addition to their declared distrust, they had less-public motives for moving against him. The autocratic rulers of Russia, Prussia and Austria wanted to crush the revolutionary ideas for which Napoleon stood, including meritocracy, equality before the law, anti-feudalism and religious toleration. Essentially, they wanted to turn the clock back to a time when Europe was safe for aristocracy. At this they succeeded&mdash;until the outbreak of the Great War a century later.</p>\n<p>The British had long enjoyed most of the key Enlightenment values, having beheaded King Charles I 140 years before the French guillotined Louis XVI, but they had other reasons for wanting to destroy Napoleon. Anything that distracted the British public&rsquo;s attention from Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s victory at New Orleans in January 1815 was very welcome, not least because the British commander there, Gen. Edward Pakenham, was the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s brother-in-law. More gravely, Britain and France had fought each other for no fewer than 56 years in the preceding 125, and Napoleon himself had posed a threat of invasion before Lord Nelson destroyed the French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar in 1805. With the French threat removed, the British were able to sign a peace treaty securing strategically important points around the globe, such as Cape Town, Jamaica and Sri Lanka, from which they could project their maritime power into a new empire to replace the one they&rsquo;d lost in America. They, too, succeeded, building the largest empire in world history, which by the dawn of the 20th century covered nearly a quarter of the world&rsquo;s land surface. The British could have achieved those goals even if they&rsquo;d left Napoleon alone; they had total control of the oceans.</p>\n<p>Once it became clear that the Allies were amassing huge armies to invade France and depose him again, Napoleon acted swiftly, leaving Paris on June 12 and striking north to defeat the Anglo-Allied army under Wellington and the Prussian Army under von Bl&uuml;cher before the Austrian and Russian armies, totaling half a million men, could arrive.</p>\n<p>**********</p>\n<p>Wellington later described the Battle of Waterloo as &ldquo;the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life.&rdquo; Initially, the French outnumbered their opponents, especially in artillery. They were a homogeneous national force, and their morale was high, since they believed their commander was the greatest soldier since Julius Caesar. The first stages of the Waterloo campaign also saw Napoleon returning to the best of his strategic abilities. He wanted to fight in modern-day Belgium (then officially known as the Austrian Netherlands, though they no longer belonged to Austria) because the British and Prussian troops were far apart, and because capturing Brussels would be a great boost to French morale and might force the British Army off the Continent altogether. By achieving a brilliant feint toward the west, he managed to steal a day&rsquo;s march on Wellington. &ldquo;Napoleon has humbugged me, by God,&rdquo; the Briton exclaimed.</p>\n<p>Napoleon wanted to strike at the hinge between the Prussian and British armies, as he had done on other battlefields for nearly 20 years, and at first it seemed as if he&rsquo;d succeeded. At the Battle of Ligny on June 16, he pinned the Prussians in place with a frontal attack and ordered a corps of 20,000 men under Gen. Jean-Baptiste d&rsquo;Erlon to fall on the enemy&rsquo;s exposed right flank. Had d&rsquo;Erlon arrived as planned, it would have turned a respectable victory for Napoleon into a devastating rout of the Prussians. Instead, just as he was about to engage, d&rsquo;Erlon received urgent orders from Marshal Ney to support Ney miles to the west, and so d&rsquo;Erlon marched.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Incomprehensible day,&rdquo; Napoleon later said of that fateful June 18, admitting that he &ldquo;did not thoroughly understand the battle,&rdquo; the loss of which he blamed on &ldquo;a combination of extraordinary Fates.&rdquo; In fact, it was not incomprehensible at all: Napoleon split his army disastrously the day before the battle, put his senior marshals in the wrong roles, failed to attack early enough in the morning, didn&rsquo;t discern that the Prussians were going to arrive in the afternoon, launched his major infantry attack in the wrong formation and his major cavalry attack at the wrong time (and unsupported by infantry and horse artillery), and unleashed his Imperial Guard too late. As he told one of his captors the following year: &ldquo;In war, the game is always with him who commits the fewest faults.&rdquo; At Waterloo, that was undoubtedly Wellington.</p>\n<p>If Napoleon had remained emperor of France for the six years remaining in his natural life, European civilization would have benefited inestimably. The reactionary Holy Alliance of Russia, Prussia and Austria would not have been able to crush liberal constitutionalist movements in Spain, Greece, Eastern Europe and elsewhere; pressure to join France in abolishing slavery in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean would have grown; the benefits of meritocracy over feudalism would have had time to become more widely appreciated; Jews would not have been forced back into their ghettos in the Papal States and made to wear the yellow star again; encouragement of the arts and sciences would have been better understood and copied; and the plans to rebuild Paris would have been implemented, making it the most gorgeous city in the world.</p>\n<p>Napoleon deserved to lose Waterloo, and Wellington to win it, but the essential point in this bicentenary year is that the epic battle did not need to be fought&mdash;and the world would have been better off if it hadn&rsquo;t been.</p>'),

Westward expansion fueled conflict with Native populations and led to their forced removal. By 1820, 2 million Americans lived west of the Appalachians, out of a total national population of 10 million. The regional cultures that had developed along the Atlantic Coast&mdash;New England, Middle Atlantic, Chesapeake, and Carolinas&mdash;were transplanted into the Old Northwest (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin) and the Old Southwest (Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas). But although Americans had begun to identify themselves as a nation, they were divided by sectional interests that deepened with rapid industrialization and the question of slavery.</p>\n<p>Americans steadily achieved economic independence from Europe. Rural Americans, once exclusively farmers, began manufacturing, merchants constructed regional market economies, and state governments promoted economic development. Industrialists remade rural villages into burgeoning factory towns such as Lowell, Massachusetts, the center of cotton textile manufacture. However, many textiles continued to be made in individual households and small weaving workshops. Mill owners called upon machines and factory operatives to boost production. Government leaders and entrepreneurs campaigned for the construction of canals and railroads that helped create a vast national market. Robert Fulton&rsquo;s (1765&ndash;1815; 14.135) steamboat, the Clermont, made its first trip up the Hudson River in 1807. The old Atlantic port cities&mdash;Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore&mdash;continued to grow with the opening of trade to China in 1785. But New York&rsquo;s rise was phenomenal, with its great harbor, its growing financial infrastructure, and the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 (1982.4a, b)&mdash;promoted by New York Governor DeWitt Clinton (1769&ndash;1828; 09.18)&mdash;connecting the metropolis with the interior of the country.</p>\n<p>Generally factories rose in the countryside next to the banks of rapidly moving streams and rivers that provided water power to turn large wheels for machinery. Remarkable changes occurred within urban workshops. Some artisans exchanged the workbench for the role of manufacturer or businessman, producing more goods by dividing up the tasks by which objects such as chairs and silver are created; as workers specialized in particular aspects of production, the operation became more efficient. Many traditionally trained mechanics and other craftsmen who had expected to rise up the ladder from apprentice to journeyman, and then master, found their social position threatened by these developments. Furniture makers began to maintain well-stocked warehouses of Federal or Neoclassical furniture (1995.377.1). Wealth no longer derived exclusively from landownership. Urban families with great fortunes from new sources-merchants, factory owners, financiers-patronized the workshops of urban cabinetmakers, silversmiths, and other skilled craftsmen.</p>\n<p>The political calm that had characterized the first term of President George Washington (1732&ndash;1799) was soon disrupted by the rise of party conflict between the Federalists and the Republicans. The presidency of Thomas Jefferson (1743&ndash;1826) launched a quarter century of Republican rule, interrupted by another war with Great Britain, the War of 1812. The geographic confrontation over slavery would not be resolved by the Missouri Compromise in 1820, which maintained a sectional balance between southern and northern states in the U.S. Senate and set boundaries for slavery in the lands of the Louisiana Purchase. Change also fueled a process of political democratization&mdash;an expansion of the white male population able to vote and hold office&mdash;leading to the rise of Andrew Jackson (1767&ndash;1845; 1978.57; 2000.562) and the new Democratic Party. Foreign observers such as the French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville (1805&ndash;1859) remarked on the democratic character of American society, where families moved frequently and individuals were liberated from the restraints of tradition and hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Cultural independence proved harder to achieve. Despite the great focus on nature in American society, tastemakers continued to look abroad for classical and then revival styles. While folk painters roamed rural areas to provide portraits for middling Americans, the European tour and grand historical themes remained critical to the work of academic painters and sculptors. At the same time, new cultural institutions on home soil provided opportunities for artists to study and exhibit. The artistic career of Samuel F. B. Morse (1791&ndash;1872) is exemplary. He began as a rural portraitist, took the Grand Tour of European capitals and art collections, and, upon returning to New York, sought commissions for high-style portraits and historical studies. In 1825, he co-founded the National Academy of Design and served as its first president.</p>'),

The World Bank economist mentioned at the beginning of the article, Lawrence Summers, has since moved on to a job as President Clinton\'s top international economist at the Treasury Department.<br/> Lawrence Summers, who was the World Bank\'s Chief Economist and was responsible for the 1992 World Development Report devoted to the economics of the environment, suggested that it makes economic sense to shift polluting industries to the Third World countries. In a memo to a senior World Bank staff dated 12 December 1991, the Chief Economist wrote, \"just between you and me, shouldn\'t the World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the LDCs [less developed countries]?\"<br/> Summers justified his economic logic of increasing pollution in the Third World on the following grounds. Firstly, since wages are low in the Third World, economic costs of pollution arising from increased illness and death are lowest in the poorest countries. Summers thinks \"that the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable, and we should face up to that.\"<br/> Secondly, since in large parts of the Third World, pollution is still low, it makes economic sense to Summers to introduce pollution. \"I\'ve always thought,\" he says, that \"underpopulated countries in Africa are vastly under-polluted; their air quality is probably vastly inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City.\"<br/> Finally, since the poor are poor, they cannot possibly worry about environmental problems. \"The concerns over an agent that causes a one-in-a-million change in the odds of prostate cancer is obviously going to be much higher in a country where people survive to get prostate cancer than in a country where under-five mortality is 200 per thousand.\"<br/> The World Bank apologized for Summers\' memo. But that does not alter the fact that the World Bank has, in fact, been financing the relocation of pollution-intensive industry to the Third World. As steel plants close in the North, the Bank helps the expansion of steel manufacturing in India. It has financed the displacement of millions of tribals to build the Challdil and Icha dams of the Suvernarekha project and to support the expansion of the Tata\'s Steel Plant at Jamshedpur.<br/> It continues to finance superthermal power plants to facilitate the relocation of energy-intensive industry to the Third World. When fertilizer surpluses grew in America, the World Bank gave credit to push chemical fertilizers in India.<br/> The World Bank\'s practice shows that Summers\' memo is not an aberration, but is consistent with the vision of an environmental apartheid, separate development for the North and the South. The North benefits in four ways from this arrangement of apartheid.<br/> First of all, Northern businesses are able to sell, through so-called \"transfer of technology\" financed by loans and debts, obsolete production systems and products, which they otherwise have to dump because of stricter regulations at home.<br/> Secondly, Northern banks, including the multilateral development banks like the World Bank, are able to make interest on loans and credits given for the transfer of environmentally unsound technology.<br/> Thirdly, the resultant financial debts give the North more political and economic control over the Third World through International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditionalities and structural adjustment loans, which push the Third World further into debt.<br/> Finally, the increased pollution and environmental degradation of the Third World is also used as a new reason for control through green conditionalities.<br/> The Third World is pushed inexorably into deeper debt, deeper poverty, deeper environmental degradation and deeper erosion of its sovereignty and democratic structures. The malaise that allows these processes to grow is not limited to one economist like Summers or one agency like the World Bank.<br/> Apartheid seems to have become the way of thinking of all the dominant powers of the North. Apartheid is, in the final analysis, a racist world view that moralizes injustice on grounds of the false assumption of the superior status of the white race and the inferiority of the rest of us. We can be polluted and poisoned because we are lesser beings in the eyes and minds of those who want to rule the world. A brown or black child does not deserve the same protection from health and environmental hazards because he or she is not white.<br/> This apartheid philosophy is fast emerging as the ruling philosophy of the North. It finds its echo in a paper by Dr. Maurice King in the Lancet, in which he recommends that health care should be removed for children in the Third World and that they should be allowed to die because Third World populations are a burden on the planet. Apartheid is also the underlying philosophy of the report from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on Trade and the environment.<br/> On the face of it, GATT\'s report opposes environmental imperialism. It refers to the recent GATT ruling against a US decision to ban imports of Mexican Yellowfin tuna because fishing methods led to the deaths of dolphins that swim about the tuna shoals. The GATT ruling says, \"A country may not restrict imports of a product solely because it originates in a country whose environmental policies are different.\" GATT says that \"countries are not clones of each other. They have a sovereign right to declare different environmental priorities and policies.\"<br/> However, when it comes to intellectual property rights (IPRs) and patents, GATT insists on a uniform law globally. IPRs are in effect instruments of control over biological resources and biodiversity that are concentrated in the Third World. When applied to living resources and life forms, they are ultimately laws about the environment.<br/> GATT\'s report is, in reality, the recipe for an environmental apartheid. The report on Trade and the Environment appears to be against protectionism in the North, but environmental laws are treated uniformly and as being \"global\" when they relate to controlling the resources of the Third World. All countries are treated a clones of each other in the case of patents of life forms. On the other hand, when environmental laws relate to pollution and hazards, the Third World is treated differently. \"National Sovereignty\" is used to justify the localization of pollution, but \"National Sovereignty\" is sacrificed to justify the globalization of access to the biological wealth of the Third World.<br/> The environmental \"bads\" inherited from the North are thus made the South\'s exclusive legacy. Environmental \"goods\" like biodiversity, which have been the South\'s heritage in the past, are transformed into a \"global heritage of mankind.\"<br/> Some Third World elites and governments will be happy with this arrangement of apartheid because it allows them to participate in the robbery of people\'s resources, and it frees them of social responsibility to protect their fellow citizens from pollution and other environmental hazards. They have taken the resources from local communities. The pollution they invite will not be theirs to suffer. A part of the South will thus be jubilant as this face-saving device of \"National Sovereignty\" is used for \"free\" export of resources from South to North and \"free\" import of pollution from North to South.<br/> The words \"freedom\" and \"protection\" have been robbed of their humane meaning and are being absorbed into the double-speak of corporate jargon. With double-speak comes a double standard, one for citizens and one for corporations, one for corporate responsibility and one for corporate profits, one for the North and one for the South.<br/> The US is most sophisticated in the practice of double standards and the destruction of people\'s rights to health and safety in the Third World. On one hand, it aims at regulating safeguards within its own geographical boundaries, while on the other hand, through Super 301 [the US law that allows for penalties against foreign goods sold in the US below cost of production], it aims at destroying the Indian Patents Act of 1970 and replacing it with a strong US-style system of patent protection, which is heavily biased in favor of the industrially developed countries.<br/> The World Bank and GATT consider the transnationals\' lack of patent protection as unfair trading practice. They do not consider the destruction of regulations for public safety and environmental protection as unethical and unfair for the citizens of the Third World. The Northern agencies want to limit and localize laws for the protection of people and universalize laws for the protection of profits. The people of India want the reverse - a universalization of the safety regulations protecting people\'s livelihoods and right to live and a localization of laws relating to intellectual property and private profits.<br/> All life is precious. It is equally precious to the rich and the poor, whites and blacks, men and women. Universalization of the protection of life is an ethical imperative. On the other hand, private property and private profits are culturally and socio-economically legitimized constructs holding only for some groups. They do not hold for all societies and all cultures. Laws for the protection of private property rights, especially as related to life forms, cannot and should not be imposed globally. They need to be restrained.</p>'),

Such patrols are a basic requirement for the rules-based global order that Australia says it is committed to upholding.</p>\n<p>An international tribunal ruled in July that China&rsquo;s bid to claim most of the sea violates international law. But the verdict will be rendered moot unless law-abiding states are willing to push back. That would give Beijing effective control over the 60% of Australian trade that transits the sea.</p>\n<p>Some Aussies understand the importance of defending maritime law, including current leaders of the opposition Labor Party. &ldquo;In our view, there should be full authorization to engage in freedom-of-navigation operations, which are entirely consistent with international law and entirely consistent with the Court of Arbitration&rsquo;s ruling,&rdquo; said Labor&rsquo;s Shadow Defense Minister Richard Marles this month. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that in supporting the rule of law internationally and the rules-based order that we do everything we can to assert that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The ruling Liberals rejected this. Naval patrols within 12 miles of Chinese-claimed features would &ldquo;escalate tensions,&rdquo; said Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, echoing language often used by Chinese officials. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull condemned Labor&rsquo;s position as a &ldquo;highly political&rdquo; sign of &ldquo;immaturity and unreadiness to take responsibility for these issues.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>These political battle lines are a surprise. The right-of-center Liberals are usually tougher on defense, and their former leader Tony Abbott, who was Prime Minister until last year, backs stepped-up sea patrols. &ldquo;We should be prepared to exercise our rights to freedom of navigation wherever international law permits,&rdquo; he said in February.</p>\n<p>Labor has lately been caught up in scandals over Chinese influence-peddling, with rising star Senator Sam Dastyari resigning from the leadership last month after he accepted gifts from Chinese interests and endorsed Beijing&rsquo;s position on the South China Sea. Several retired Labor grandees, including former Prime Minister Paul Keating and former Foreign Minister Bob Carr, have called for accommodating China and moving away from the U.S. So kudos to current Labor leaders for getting this one right, but they&rsquo;re not in charge.</p>\n<p>The Liberals&rsquo; climbdown is particularly damaging because it follows a long campaign of bullying from Chinese officials and state media. &ldquo;Australia is not a party to the South China Sea issue&rdquo; and must &ldquo;carefully talk and cautiously behave,&rdquo; Beijing&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry warned after Aussie officials praised the tribunal verdict in July. The state-run Global Times threatened, &ldquo;If Australia steps into the South China Sea waters, it will be an ideal target for China to warn and strike.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Canberra&rsquo;s decision can&rsquo;t be separated from Washington&rsquo;s ambivalence. As U.S. officials encouraged Australia to step up, the Obama Administration authorized a mere three U.S. freedom of navigation patrols, all under the minimalist doctrine of &ldquo;innocent passage&rdquo; and after months of hand-wringing that undermined the intended signal of resolve. If the next U.S. President takes a more serious approach, it might inspire Canberra to do the same.</p>'),

And much of that coal was used to power factories in China and other rising economies that produce goods for US and European consumers, the draft adds.</p>\n<p>Since 2000, annual carbon dioxide emissions for China and the other rising economies have more than doubled to nearly 14 gigatonnes a year, according to the draft report. But about 2 GT a year of that was produced making goods for export.</p>\n<p>The picture is similar for other rising economies producing goods for export, the report finds.</p>\n<p>\"A growing share of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in developing countries is released in the production of goods and services exported, notably from upper-middle-income countries to high-income countries,\" the report says.</p>\n<p>Other middle income countries, with smaller exports, saw a more gradual rise in emissions. For the poorest countries in the world, however, emissions have flatlined since 1990.</p>\n<p>Factories in China and other rising economies now produce more carbon pollution than industries in America and Europe.</p>\n<p>\"A growing share of global emissions is released in the manufacture of products that are traded across international borders,\" the draft says.</p>\n<p>The newly wealthy elites of China, India and Brazil are flying more, buying more cars and otherwise fuelling the consumption that is driving climate change.</p>\n<p>But their per capita greenhouse gas emissions are still below those in America and Europe &ndash; a gap that China and India regularly cite at climate talks to deflect pressure to cut emissions.</p>\n<p>In addition, a large and growing share of the carbon pollution attributed to China and those rising economies was generated in the production of goods that ended up in America and Europe.</p>\n<p>The outsourcing of those emissions has skewed efforts to account for all global emissions, which typically was conducted on a national basis. Those accounting efforts are no longer accurate, according to analysts.</p>\n<p>\"If we are just looking at our national inventory to understand the emissions trends, it is just not telling the full picture of our impacts,\" said Cynthia Cummis, an expert on greenhouse gas accounting at the World Resources Institute. \"We need to understand the full life cycle of all the goods and services that we are purchasing and selling.\"</p>\n<p>There is now growing debate about how to assign responsibility for emissions generated producing goods that were made in one country but ultimately destined for another.</p>\n<p>\"The consumers that are importing those goods have some responsibility for those goods that are happening outside of our boundaries,\" Cummis said.</p>\n<p>The 29-page draft, a summary for policy makers, was dated 17 December. An edited version is due to be published in Germany in April.</p>\n<p>The report is the third in a series by the IPCC, summing up the state of the climate crisis since 2007 and prospects for solutions. The first part was released in September. It is stark about the chances of avoiding dangerous climate change &ndash; especially if deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are pushed back beyond 2030.</p>\n<p>Temperatures have already risen by 0.8C since the dawning of the industrial age, the report says.</p>\n<p>Unless there are deep cuts in emissions &ndash; up to 70% of current levels by 2050 &ndash; or a near-quadrupling of renewable energy, governments may have to fall back increasingly on experimental technologies for sucking carbon dioxide from the air to avoid dangerous warming, the report says.</p>'),

I am talking about the entire emerging markets world led by China who is exempt from doing anything about carbon emissions or any other kind of pollution.</p>\n<p>Environmentalists have the same head in the sand attitude and never protest what the emerging market is doing to foul their own air and water and to increase their greenhouse gas emissions. Instead environmentalists endlessly badmouth the industrialized world which has done a huge amount of pollution control while losing millions of jobs to the emerging markets since NAFTA and the Kyoto Protocol came into existence and the emerging markets joined the World trade Organization.</p>\n<p>Does free trade coupled with the Kyoto Protocol actually make global warming worse overall? I think they do. I think that ignoring the massive polluters in the emerging markets created a situation where no matter how hard the industrialized countries try to limit their emissions the overall world situation gets worse and more people in the industrialized countries will stay unemployed.</p>\n<p>This is why Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in December 2011. The Canadian government said at the time that they were not going to lose any more jobs because of the ridiculous goals in the Kyoto Protocols and they were not going to pay any fines to the emerging markets for not meeting their goals.</p>\n<p>I suggest that the EU, U.S. and Canada put a carbon tax on all products manufactured in the emerging markets unless they reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and reduce their other forms of pollution. Now the emerging market countries like China are demanding that we pay to clean up their pollution because they are poor.</p>\n<p>The emerging market countries are not just gigantic greenhouse gas emitters but they also are destroying rain forests and polluting rivers and of course their air. The industrialized world is heavily in debt now and cannot afford to pay for cleaning up the pollution that the emerging market countries have created over years since they joined the WTO.</p>\n<p>Auto production and light vehicles in China will exceed that of Europe this year. Jobs and pollution have gone to the emerging markets under the Kyoto Protocol and free trade that exempts the emerging market countries from having to do anything about global warming or other forms of pollution.</p>\n<p>The efforts to reduce global warming gasses in the industrialized world under the Kyoto Protocol coupled with free trade has made the overall situation worse in the world because of the massive increase in greenhouse gasses in the emerging market countries and also their much higher birth rates.</p>\n<p>The more we increase the cost of energy in the industrialized world the more overall pollution will rise in the world because people in the emerging markets who use very little carbon are now using much more carbon based fuels at work and for their own personal use.</p>\n<p>Our leaders and all green groups seem blind to what\'s happened and what is happening every day now. In fact the greens protest all the time against the Keystone pipeline and against Canada for its development of shale oil and tar sands oil while they NEVER protest in front of the Chinese embassy or the Mexican embassy about the massive pollution in those two countries and the degradation of life itself from massive regular pollution plus global warming gas pollution.</p>\n<p>The emerging market countries have become our creditors and have run up gigantic trade surpluses with the U.S. due to many factors including unlimited capacity to pollute, very weak labor laws, child labor, close to slave labor in the North Korean special manufacturing zones that South Korean companies utilize, manipulated currencies, special rules for them under the WTO rules that allow them to control investments in their countries and percentage ownership by outsiders and to block our products while we cannot easily block their products.</p>\n<p>Other than that, we have a perfect Free Trade regime with the emerging market countries. You have to wonder why our political masters here and in Europe have gone along with the present system and why the labor unions, environmental groups and academia have not complained much about the system either.</p>\n<p>This could not have happened without the WTO agreement and other bilateral trade agreements starting with NAFTA with Mexico that went into effect in 1994 and the WTO agreements with most of the emerging market countries in 1995.</p>\n<p>China, after excruciating negotiations that gave China many advantages over the USA and Europe, entered the WTO in 2001. I might point out that I know of not even one bilateral trade agreement that we have entered into for the past 30 years that resulted in the U.S. ending up with a trade surplus with that country.</p>\n<p>My theory contains a multiplier effect that no one else has ever mentioned. The effect is obvious. Not only do the electric generation plants in the emerging markets have less or no anti-pollution equipment on them but also they run on coal and have internal combustion engines running on diesel or gasoline</p>\n<p>As people moved to the cities for jobs in factories and then were able to buy motor vehicles the combination of more motor vehicles and electricity generation and construction equipment to build out the infrastructure created a gigantic increase in greenhouse gasses in the world.</p>\n<p>As the industrialized world sent more and more production to China and the rest of the emerging markets it kept its displaced workforce on generous welfare plans that kept them using carbon based fuels while they were unemployed. So, as the industrialized world did more to reduce its greenhouse gases, worldwide emissions grew worse.</p>\n<p>Industry runs on electricity. If you raise the price of electricity because of carbon taxes or very high cost wind power or solar power you drive production to the emerging markets like China that have low cost electricity and very few pollution standards on regular pollution. It was after most of the emerging markets entered the WTO in 1995, NAFTA in1994 and the Kyoto Protocol came into effect in 2005, that the specter of massive air pollution in China and Mexico and other emerging market countries came about.</p>\n<p>To reiterate the vicious cycle of more jobs, more production, and more vehicles on the road means more pollution of all kinds worldwide until the industrialized world wakes up and puts carbon taxes on the real polluters in the emerging markets and not on themselves as they have been doing since</p>\n<p>The U.S. has lost millions of jobs due to the massive movement of production to China, Mexico and other emerging market countries. However, our electricity rates are mostly lower than Europe\'s and we have not subsidized our conversion to alternative energy as much as Europe.</p>\n<p>The U.S. has also avoided a national carbon tax scheme and now has abundant cheap natural gas to power electric generation plants. This has already lowered greenhouse gas emissions tremendously. Of course, the loss of production in the industrialized world has lowered its emissions as well.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is fast becoming much more productive than Europe as our conversion to natural gas as a feedstock for many industries grows and as our electricity generation switches to low cost natural gas. This has alarmed the EU and they want to force us to adopt carbon taxes or to make new trade agreements with them to level the playing field.</p>\n<p>The EU has ignored the greenhouse gasses that are coming from China and instead flogs itself to death with more and more carbon schemes and unaffordable alternative energy. One reason for the gigantic budget deficits in the EU states are the subsidies for alternative energy and the endless welfare for the people who cannot find work.</p>\n<p>Even with unemployment at record high levels in the southern states of the EU that rely heavily on tourism, the EU wants to implement a carbon tax on airlines which is really a carbon tax on tourism. All the emerging market countries are against this carbon tax on airlines and the U.S. is against it as well. The amazing thing is that none of the southern countries in the EU has protested against this silly tax on tourism.</p>\n<p>The EU of course could care less, as it is a bureaucracy second to now in the world and answers only to itself until very recently when the British forced a slight cut in its budget.</p>'),

The government had to issue a Jones Act waiver for a Russian&nbsp;tanker to bring gasoline&nbsp;from Dutch Harbor&nbsp;because there were no U.S. vessels available to do it.

As genocide gripped Rwanda, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMR) became one of the most catastrophic failures of the UN since its inception.</p>\n<p>Any supposed peace agreement was quickly overshadowed as over 800,000 innocent Rwandans were systematically slaughtered. One by one, peacekeeping contingents backed out, until only 270 personnel remained. From here on, skepticism about peacekeeping became palpably justified.</p>\n<p>And over two decades later, as London hosted the annual UN Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial on 8 September, peacekeeping operations are still dogged by accusations of gross failure.</p>\n<p>In 2014, in the Democratic Republic of Congo&rsquo;s South Kivu province, peacekeepers failed to prevent the massacre of 30 civilians in an apparent case of ethnic cleansing by local guerrillas. In 2015, a leaked Human Rights Watch Report notes, French Peacekeeping soldiers had been sexually abusing children in the Central African Republic.</p>\n<p>Finally and most recently, in 2016 the United Nation Mission in the Republic of South Sudan has been accused of negligence after peacekeepers turned a blind eye to distress calls from humanitarian workers trapped in a Juba compound who were being raped, robbed and terrorized by pro-government forces.</p>\n<p>Here lie some of the problems facing the UN as a trans-governmental department: the legal quagmire over jurisdiction, crime and punishment. The bureaucracy and poor oversight from the top, accusations of poor discipline and misconduct at the bottom.</p>\n<p>The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) needs reform. Indeed, in 2014 Ban Ki Moon ordered an independent review of all peacekeeping operations, to see where things have gone wrong, but on 8 September 2016, much has yet to be addressed.</p>\n<p>Despite this, it must not be forgotten the good work peacekeepers do: Over 100,000 uniformed personnel from over 110 countries are currently deployed in 16 operations, spread across four continents. Some 3,300 more have been killed in the line of duty, and thousands put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way. Overall, over one million have served in peacekeeping forces, their jobs have varied from monitoring ceasefires and observing elections, to aiding reconstruction and promoting reconciliation. They are guided by three principles: Consent of the parties, Impartiality, and the Non-use of force except in self-defence and defence of the mandate. All of these have negatives that are all too obvious, but their are also positives as well.</p>\n<p>Peacekeepers do not dispose of a military force like NATO, they are not there for combat; rather they are their primarily to facilitate countries who are going through civil turbulence. There is a limit to what they can do, but where peacekeepers have been deployed they have been a great stabilizing factor for many countries.</p>\n<p>For example, the Republic of Haiti was in a state of collapse after the 2010 earthquake. Essential services like hospitals, communications systems and shelters were damaged or destroyed. Between 100,000 to 220,000 people were killed; more than million were displaced. Shortages of fuel, food and water, and a subsequent outbreak of cholera only exacerbated conditions. Peacekeepers were already established in the country, and in spite of the fact their own headquarters were obliterated, they aided recovery and reconstruction in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>In Mali, peacekeepers are maintaining a fragile peace, as Islamist insurgents are encroaching on the country&rsquo;s north. At the same time, they are stabilizing the state-led response and promoting democratic reform. The mandate has proved vital, and Mali has requested continual support, as it transitions into a reformed state with secure borders.</p>\n<p>Finally, in Lebanon more than 11,000 peacekeepers are monitoring the ceasefire between the Israel Defense Forces and Hezbollah. They are also accompanying the Lebanese army, guarding security checkpoints, and aiding the humanitarian effort to help the local communities across the so called &lsquo;blue line&rsquo; reconstruct their lives. A cross-state solution, brokered between Israel and Lebanon aims create a bilateral governance. This is one of the UN&rsquo;s most successful peacekeeping operations to date.</p>\n<p>However again, we come back to the central problem: How is peace maintained in an unstable and dangerous world? Peacekeepers flourished in the height of the Cold War, but the lines of battle have changed: Instead of interstate conflicts and espionage, we are seeing increasingly violent forms of extremism and insurgency drawn along sectarian divisions.</p>\n<p>The UN DPKO is not an army; its mandate is to maintain peace, not attain it. As such, as well as structural reform and bearing in mind cross-party consensus and international co-operation, the United Nations must seriously look at its operations, and see where personnel are best utilized, for poor management, vague missions, and the volatile nature of modern warfare would hurt their chances of success.</p>'),

Verwoerd, sat in the seat of the Prime Minister before the all-white Parliament of South Africa. With his white hair swept neatly to one side, he held himself with confidence. Verwoerd, 64, was the proud Afrikaner who set in stone the segregation of South Africa. He listened as bells called his fellow legislators to the chamber.</p>\n<p>It was a day South Africans would remember for decades to come. At a quarter-past-two, a Parliamentary messenger suddenly rushed into the room. In his official uniform, he must have gone largely unnoticed. But then the messenger&mdash;later described as &ldquo;a tall, powerful, gray-haired man in his late 40s&rdquo;&mdash;produced a knife and stabbed Verwoerd four times in the chest and neck. The Prime Minister slumped forward, blood pouring from his body. By the time Verwoerd\'s colleagues had pinned down the assassin&mdash;a mentally ill half-Greek, half-black man named Dimitri Tsafendas&mdash;the carpet was stained with blood. Verwoerd was dead before he reached a hospital.</p>\n<p>His funeral ceremony was attended by a quarter-million South Africans, the vast majority of whom were white. The architect was dead, but his policies were not; the system that Verwoerd helped to establish would continue to subjugate black South Africans for almost three decades.</p>\n<p>In the 50 years that have passed since H.F. Verwoerd was assassinated, his reputation as a hero of white South Africa has eroded so thoroughly that he now symbolizes&mdash;even epitomizes&mdash;racism and brutality. His assassin, meanwhile, remains an enigma&mdash;a man whom some condemn, some celebrate and some simply ignore. Declared mentally unfit for trial, in part because he spoke bizarrely about a tapeworm that supposedly directed his actions, Tsafendas would end up outliving apartheid, but he would die behind bars as South Africa\'s longest-serving prisoner. To trace the legacy of both men today is to trace fault lines that still cut through South African society.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Among black South Africans, even the name Verwoerd inspires wrath. &ldquo;I have vivid memories of what Verwoerd did to us,&rdquo; says Nomavenda Mathiane, who worked for decades as an anti-apartheid journalist. She remembers that, during high school in 1960, her teacher announced that Verwoerd had been shot in an earlier, unsuccessful assassination attempt. The class broke out into applause.</p>\n<p>Mathiane struggles to explain how powerful a symbol Verwoerd has become. At one point, by way of illustration, she compares him to Hitler. &ldquo;We were happy that he died,&rdquo; she remembers.</p>\n<p>Verwoerd\'s notoriety began with one particular piece of legislation&mdash;the Bantu Education Act, passed in 1953. Like Jim Crow laws in the United States, the act preserved the privileges of white South Africans at the expense of people of color. It forced millions of black South Africans (who the apartheid government referred to as &ldquo;Bantu&rdquo;) to attend separate and decidedly unequal schools. &ldquo;The Bantu must be guided to serve his own community in all respects,&rdquo; Verwoerd said in June 1954. &ldquo;There is no place for him in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour. Within his own community, however, all doors are open&rdquo;</p>\n<p>These memories deeply anger Mathiane. &ldquo;After white people had taken the land, after white people had impoverished us in South Africa, the only way out of our poverty was through education,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And he came up with the idea of giving us an inferior education.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Verwoerd became prime minister in 1958, and during his tenure, segregation only worsened. Anti-apartheid activism was banned, and using earlier laws like the 1950 Group Areas Act and the 1953 Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, Verwoerd helped extend his education policies to the layout of cities and states. The philosophy of &ldquo;grand apartheid&rdquo; was used to justify the forced relocation of millions of non-white South Africans.</p>\n<p>What South Africans disagree about is whether Verwoerd deserved his demise&mdash;and whether his assassin deserves our respect. Half a century after the assassination, in the Sunday Times newspaper, two recent articles suggest that there\'s still room for debate. &ldquo;No place for heroes in story of Verwoerd and Tsafendas,&rdquo; declared one headline. &ldquo;Hendrik Verwoerd\'s killer a freedom fighter?&rdquo; asked another.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think to some regard he should be taken as some sort of hero,&rdquo; says Thobeka Nkabinde, a student at South Africa&rsquo;s Stellenbosch University. &ldquo;Hendrik Verwoerd was a bad person and a bad man, and his death can only by me be seen as a positive thing,&rdquo; she adds. Harris Dousemetzis, a researcher based at Durham University, goes so far as to portray Tsafendas as a self-aware political assassin who may not have acted alone.</p>\n<p>One reason the story still carries weight is that the psychological traces of Verwoerd are made physical in places like Cape Town, a city that remains notoriously segregated. &ldquo;In South Africa, you drive into a town, and you see a predominantly white area, a predominantly black area, and then a predominantly colored area,&rdquo; Nkabinde says, using the South African term for mixed-race. &ldquo;The white area is the richest.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Last year, Nkabinde joined the burgeoning &ldquo;decolonization&rdquo; movement that has been sweeping the country. Much like the efforts of activists and legislators in the United States to bring down or contextualize monuments to the Confederacy, South African activists seek to deny colonialist figures the honor of plaques, statues and place names. For her&mdash;a first-generation university student&mdash;this history was deeply personal. Nkabinde and her fellow students demanded the removal of a Verwoerd plaque; in response to their efforts, it was taken down, as was a statue of the mining magnate Cecil John Rhodes at the University of Cape Town.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>For a long time, white South Africans viewed Verwoerd from a strikingly different perspective than blacks. A few still bear his name&mdash;including Melanie Verwoed, a well-known politician who adopted the family name by marriage (her ex-husband is H.F. Verwoerd\'s grandson). &ldquo;If you speak to Afrikaans[-speaking] white people, as a rule, they would be very, very impressed that you\'re a Verwoerd.&rdquo; Her own family viewed him as a smart and effective leader&mdash;a perspective that it took her many years to reject.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you carry a surname like Verwoerd in South Africa, you always get a reaction,&rdquo; she says. When Melanie Verwoerd enters the country from abroad, border control officers raise their eyebrows. It can help when she explains that she fought late apartheid, and belonged to the same political party as Nelson Mandela. But her surname carries too much weight to be easily shrugged off. &ldquo;Sometimes if I say I\'m one of the good Verwoerds, jokingly, I get told there is no such thing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Only a tiny minority of South Africans stubbornly maintain that H.F. Verwoerd was a good man. I called his grandson Wynand Boshoff, who used to live in the &ldquo;white homeland&rdquo; of Orania, a remote town populated by Afrikaner nationalists. If not for Verwoerd, &ldquo;we would have today had a much less educated black population,&rdquo; Boshoff claims, despite wide agreement to the contrary among South Africans and historians. &ldquo;As a ruler of South Africa, he did not do any additional harm to what had been done already by this whole clash of civilizations in Africa,&rdquo; Boshoff adds. When asked if he thought Verwoerd\'s vision of apartheid was a good idea at the time, he says yes.</p>\n<p>White nationalists notwithstanding, Verwoerd\'s status as a symbol of evil isn\'t likely to change anytime soon. His name is now shorthand for injustice; in Parliament, comparisons to Verwoerd have become a dagger of accusation that politicians brandish at each other. This, says Melanie Verwoerd, is for the most part a good thing. &ldquo;It\'s helpful sometimes that there is one person or policy or deed that can be blamed. It certainly unifies people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the same time, systems of oppression can seldom be summed up by the wrongdoing of an individual, and the idea of an &ldquo;evil mastermind&rdquo; seems better suited to comic books than history books. Just as Nelson Mandela has become one focal point in stories of liberation, Verwoerd has become a focal point in stories of injustice&mdash;a darkness against which wrongs are measured. Too rarely are his collaborators and successors condemned with such passion.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>In 1994, the year apartheid finally collapsed, the anti-apartheid party ANC, or African National Congress, held a meeting in the old South African Parliament&mdash;the same chamber where Dimitri Tsafendas stabbed H.F. Verwoerd. Melanie Verwoerd, who had recently won a seat in Parliament, was in attendance. So were heroes of the fight for liberation: Nelson and Winnie Mandela, Walter and Albertina Sisulu, Thabo Mbeki.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everybody stood up in these benches where all this terrible apartheid legislation had been written, and where the ANC was banned, and where Nelson Mandela was demonized,&rdquo; Melanie Verwoerd recalled. Mandela, who was about to become President of South Africa, sang Nkosi sikelel\' iAfrika&mdash;&ldquo;God Bless Africa&rdquo;&mdash;and many wept as they took their seats.</p>\n<p>History was almost palpable that day. &ldquo;Mandela was sitting in the bench where Verwoerd had been assassinated many years before,&rdquo; Melanie Verwoerd recalled. &ldquo;And in fact the carpet still had a stain on it, which they never replaced, where Verwoerd\'s blood had been spilled.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When freedom came to South Africa, the present didn\'t replace the past&mdash;it only added new layers to what had come before. This is a country that refuses to forget. &ldquo;So much blood was spilled in this country for us to get where Mandela ultimately sat on that chair,&rdquo; says the journalist Nomavenda Mathiane. Of Verwoerd, she says: &ldquo;You cannot sweep a person like that under the carpet. People must know about him, people must write about him. Because if we don\'t say these things, people will forget, and more Verwoerds will arise.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But I must say that in spite of all that, we pulled through,&rdquo; Mathiane adds, as if pushing Verwoerd\'s memory into the shadows, where it belongs. &ldquo;We survived.&rdquo;</p>'),

Some historians view it as a 20th-century development, closely linked to the peculiar evolution of South African capitalism, with its strong reliance on cheap black labor as advocated by Cecil Rhodes in the quote above. Other scholars believe apartheid was a product of earlier racial prejudices and policies imposed by Dutch and British settlers. Recent explanations point to a combination of several factors ─ colonial conquest, land dispossession, economic impoverishment, and exclusion from citizenship of Africans ─ that paved the way to apartheid. This unit explores the historical roots of apartheid, from the colonial occupation of the Cape in 1652 through the creation of the Union of South Africa and the segregation period (1910-1948). The emphasis is on patterns of economic and political transformation and how racism and segregation increasingly restricted the lives of black South Africans.</p>\n<p>Three main, interrelated forces influenced the nature of South African society and economy: colonial conquest, the expansion of mining, and the actions ─ also known as &ldquo;agency&rdquo; ─ of individuals. Colonial conquest by the Netherlands and, after 1795, by Britain, stimulated limited if uneven capitalist growth. The Dutch East India Company established a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, which gradually expanded along a frontier at the expense of the Khoikhoi, Xhosa, and other indigenous peoples, a process similar to the one that unfolded in North America, Australia, and New Zealand. In South Africa, destruction of Khoi societies produced an underclass of domestic and farm workers, but their ability to earn a decent wage was severely curtailed by the Dutch East India Company\'s use of slaves imported from Angola, Mozambique, Madagascar, and South East Asia.</p>\n<p>We know little about the lives of ordinary people of these times, but archival evidence reveals glimpses of slaves&rsquo; struggles against harsh conditions imposed by their white oppressors. Krotoa (known to the Dutch settlers as &ldquo;Eva&rdquo;) was a Khoi woman caught in the identity crisis of colonization: used by Dutch leader Jan van Riebeeck as an interpreter against her own people in the mid-1600s, she married a European but was rejected by white society. Sarah Baartman was taken in 1810 from Cape Town to Europe and displayed in exhibitions like an animal. Katie Jacobs, interviewed in 1910 as one of the last surviving ex-slaves, told of her harsh life, of a master who even refused to baptize her. Inhuman treatment sometimes led to resistance. For example, the slave woman Dina escaped during the Boers&rsquo; (or Afrikaners\') Great Trek of the 1830s. In another instance in 1825, after suffering repeated floggings, Galant van der Caab, a slave on a farm northeast of Cape Town, led a small-scale revolt of slaves. Eventually, Great Britain pronounced the emancipation of slaves in the Cape Colony in 1833, but slavery was replaced by draconian Master and Servant laws that preserved a social hierarchy in which race closely corresponded to class.</p>\n<p>The discovery of diamonds in Kimberley in 1867 and of gold on the Witwatersrand (centered on the city of Johannesburg) in 1886 transformed South African from an agrarian society at the edge of world trade into a globally integrated industrial economy. The mineral revolution led to the quick spread of European colonization into the interior. By the end of the 19th century, all the indigenous peoples of South Africa had lost their political and economic independence.</p>\n<p>Racist laws enabled the white-owned mining companies to control workers, keep wages very low, and gain immense profits from the diamonds and gold that black miners extracted from the earth. Many African men worked on the mines and farms under dangerous conditions for wages that could not sufficiently feed and clothe their families. The diamond and gold mines also imposed pass laws, a humiliating means of control (that was to continue under apartheid), which required black men to carry documents that identified where they could and could not work and live.</p>\n<p>Most African miners became migrant laborers, spending nine to eleven months of the year in the mines while their wives and children remained in the countryside. Racial discrimination in the pre-apartheid era also kept the few Africans who received training as apprentices from finding suitable employment. Furthermore, enterprising kholwa (Christian) Africans often were forced out of their jobs, even though they were qualified. By 1920, Silas Modiri Molema of the Barolong people wrote that the African &ldquo;is tabooed all round to force him to unskilled work.&rdquo; Such informal &ldquo;job color bars&rdquo; ─ limitations on what jobs one could work based on one&rsquo;s race or ethnicity ─ were a blueprint for later apartheid laws like the Job Reservation Act.</p>\n<p>Industrialization and British imperialism in South Africa, driven by economic and political ambitions, and the individual actions of mining magnates like Cecil John Rhodes, resulted in a slow but steady expansion of manufacturing and transport infrastructure. The British government fashioned a more uniform policy after the South African War of 1899-1902 (also known as the Anglo-Boer War, or Boer War), when the Act of Union of 1910 brought together the previously separate colonies of the Orange Free State, Transvaal, Natal, and the Cape to form the Union of South Africa&mdash;which later became a white dominion of the British Empire. In response, a group of black South Africans traveled to London to petition Parliament to reject the denial of the vote to Africans in the 1910 Act of Union, but their voices went unheard. In the end, the British and the Boers (Afrikaners) put aside the bitterness of war in order to entrench white power and privilege at the expense of the black South Africans&rsquo; civil and human rights.</p>\n<p>In the first two decades of Union (1910-1930), the governments of Louis Botha, Jan Smuts, and J. B. Hertzog promulgated a barrage of discriminatory laws and regulations that tightened state control over blacks. The most important law passed was the Natives&rsquo; Land Act of 1913. This law reserved 93 percent (revised to 87 percent in 1936) of the land in South Africa for whites; it prevented Africans&mdash;two-thirds of the population at the time&mdash;from freely buying land. The small African &ldquo;reserves&rdquo; created by the Land Act were a forerunner of the apartheid-era &ldquo;Bantustans&rdquo; or &ldquo;homelands.&rdquo; Life in the rural reserves was harsh, with illnesses and malnutrition rife. For many Africans, especially young men and women, migration to wage-earning jobs in cities and mines became one of the only ways to pay colonial taxes and survive.</p>\n<p>Massive urbanization was the most important social development between World War I and World War II. The number of city-dwelling Africans more than tripled in thirty years from 1904 to 1936. This urban growth occurred in a context of intensifying segregation. Africans in the cities lived in terrible conditions, with inadequate housing, poor health and transport services, and no electricity for many decades. Along with poverty came crime and fear for personal safety. Segregation also caused unprecedented gender imbalance, with more men working in urban areas than women. However, from 1921 to 1936 there was a 142 percent increase in the number of urban African women, many of whom came to the cities to be with their husbands but often lived a precarious life without legal residence rights. As more blacks moved to urban areas, whites came to view the city as &ldquo;a European area in which there is no place the redundant Native,&rdquo; in the words of the Native Affairs Commission of 1921. The 1923 Natives (Urban Areas) Act restricted African migration into towns, laying the foundations for urban residential segregation. Whites also sought to tighten control of black workers by passing laws in the 1920s that severely curtailed black economic freedom, including a prohibition on forming unions.</p>\n<p>By the 1930s, the government&rsquo;s segregationist stance hardened further. Amendments to the Masters and Servants&rsquo; Act, for instance, legalized whipping. Repressive legislation was also aimed at Indian and Coloured South Africans. Then, in 1936, the Hertzog Bills removed from the voting rolls the few Africans who were still enfranchised in the Cape. This move signaled the evisceration of black political rights. Despite intensifying racism, respect for British legalism and liberalism and contact with British and American missionaries inclined many early black leaders to use petitions, delegations, and other polite methods of protest against segregation. But Africans often invoked British values in a subversive manner intended to improve their lot by asserting their equality with whites and demanding freedom and social justice. With the hardening of white racism and segregation, more and more blacks began to identify themselves as \"Africans.\" While the segregation period saw ambiguity in the black response, protests against discriminatory policies laid an important foundation for later resistance against apartheid.</p>\n<p>There were important continuities between segregation and apartheid: in both eras, black people faced condescending and restrictive policies, discriminatory residence and labor laws, and denied voting rights. The pre-apartheid period saw considerable enforced racial separation in economy and society. In both periods, the ideology of white supremacy prevailed. These similarities have led some scholars to see apartheid simply as an intensification of segregation. Under apartheid, however, racism and segregation became thoroughly rigid and institutionalized; they permeated all aspects of life, and government repression became more ruthless. Moreover, the world historical context was changing. While white supremacy was common in European colonial empires and the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries, after 1945 colonialism and racism were in retreat. This period witnessed the independence of ex-colonies in Asia and Africa and the rise of the American civil rights movement. Why South African apartheid went against the trend of history is the focus of the next sections.</p>'),

Under apartheid, nonwhite South Africans (a majority of the population) would be forced to live in separate areas from whites and use separate public facilities, and contact between the two groups would be limited. Despite strong and consistent opposition to apartheid within and outside of South Africa, its laws remained in effect for the better part of 50 years. In 1991, the government of President F.W. de Klerk began to repeal most of the legislation that provided the basis for apartheid.</p>\n<p>BIRTH OF APARTHEID</p>\n<p>Racial segregation and white supremacy had become central aspects of South African policy long before apartheid began. The controversial 1913 Land Act, passed three years after South Africa gained its independence, marked the beginning of territorial segregation by forcing black Africans to live in reserves and making it illegal for them to work as sharecroppers. Opponents of the Land Act formed the South African National Native Congress, which would become the African National Congress (ANC).</p>\n<p>The Great Depression and World War II brought increasing economic woes to South Africa, and convinced the government to strengthen its policies of racial segregation. In 1948, the Afrikaner National Party won the general election under the slogan &ldquo;apartheid&rdquo; (literally &ldquo;separateness&rdquo;). Their goal was not only to separate South Africa&rsquo;s white minority from its non-white majority, but also to separate non-whites from each other, and to divide black South Africans along tribal lines in order to decrease their political power.</p>\n<p>APARTHEID BECOMES LAW</p>\n<p>By 1950, the government had banned marriages between whites and people of other races, and prohibited sexual relations between black and white South Africans. The Population Registration Act of 1950 provided the basic framework for apartheid by classifying all South Africans by race, including Bantu (black Africans), Coloured (mixed race) and white. A fourth category, Asian (meaning Indian and Pakistani) was later added. In some cases, the legislation split families; parents could be classified as white, while their children were classified as colored.</p>\n<p>A series of Land Acts set aside more than 80 percent of the country&rsquo;s land for the white minority, and &ldquo;pass laws&rdquo; required non-whites to carry documents authorizing their presence in restricted areas. In order to limit contact between the races, the government established separate public facilities for whites and non-whites, limited the activity of nonwhite labor unions and denied non-white participation in national government.</p>\n<p>APARTHEID AND SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT</p>\n<p>Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd, who became prime minister in 1958, would refine apartheid policy further into a system he referred to as &ldquo;separate development.&rdquo; The Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act of 1959 created 10 Bantu homelands known as Bantustans. Separating black South Africans from each other enabled the government to claim there was no black majority, and reduced the possibility that blacks would unify into one nationalist organization. Every black South African was designated as a citizen as one of the Bantustans, a system that supposedly gave them full political rights, but effectively removed them from the nation&rsquo;s political body.</p>\n<p>In one of the most devastating aspects of apartheid, the government forcibly removed black South Africans from rural areas designated as &ldquo;white&rdquo; to the homelands, and sold their land at low prices to white farmers. From 1961 to 1994, more than 3.5 million people were forcibly removed from their homes and deposited in the Bantustans, where they were plunged into poverty and hopelessness.</p>\n<p>OPPOSITION TO APARTHEID</p>\n<p>Resistance to apartheid within South Africa took many forms over the years, from non-violent demonstrations, protests and strikes to political action and eventually to armed resistance. Together with the South Indian National Congress, the ANC organized a mass meeting in 1952, during which attendees burned their pass books. A group calling itself the Congress of the People adopted a Freedom Charter in 1955 asserting that &ldquo;South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black or white.&rdquo; The government broke up the meeting and arrested 150 people, charging them with high treason.</p>\n<p>In 1960, at the black township of Sharpesville, the police opened fire on a group of unarmed blacks associated with the Pan-African Congress (PAC), an offshoot of the ANC. The group had arrived at the police station without passes, inviting arrest as an act of resistance. At least 67 blacks were killed and more than 180 wounded. Sharpesville convinced many anti-apartheid leaders that they could not achieve their objectives by peaceful means, and both the PAC and ANC established military wings, neither of which ever posed a serious military threat to the state. By 1961, most resistance leaders had been captured and sentenced to long prison terms or executed. Nelson Mandela, a founder of Umkhonto we Sizwe (&ldquo;Spear of the Nation&rdquo;), the military wing of the ANC, was incarcerated from 1963 to 1990; his imprisonment would draw international attention and help garner support for the anti-apartheid cause.</p>\n<p>APARTHEID COMES TO AN END</p>\n<p>In 1976, when thousands of black children in Soweto, a black township outside Johannesburg, demonstrated against the Afrikaans language requirement for black African students, the police opened fire with tear gas and bullets. The protests and government crackdowns that followed, combined with a national economic recession, drew more international attention to South Africa and shattered all illusions that apartheid had brought peace or prosperity to the nation. The United Nations General Assembly had denounced apartheid in 1973, and in 1976 the UN Security Council voted to impose a mandatory embargo on the sale of arms to South Africa. In 1985, the United Kingdom and United States imposed economic sanctions on the country.</p>\n<p>Under pressure from the international community, the National Party government of Pieter Botha sought to institute some reforms, including abolition of the pass laws and the ban on interracial sex and marriage. The reforms fell short of any substantive change, however, and by 1989 Botha was pressured to step aside in favor of F.W. de Klerk. De Klerk&rsquo;s government subsequently repealed the Population Registration Act, as well as most of the other legislation that formed the legal basis for apartheid. A new constitution, which enfranchised blacks and other racial groups, took effect in 1994, and elections that year led to a coalition government with a nonwhite majority, marking the official end of the apartheid system.</p>'),

While most liberals, like Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., never had any illusions about the Soviet regime, the sixties New Left included revolutionary romantics who were outright apologists for communism. Lately, however, many of those leftists have belatedly conceded that the Soviet Union was an evil empire after all.</p>\n<p>If the collapse of the Soviet Union has prompted such reflections on the left, there are no comparable signs of remorse on the right about another political failure of similar moral significance: apartheid. South Africa collapsed at the same time as the Soviet Union. Like the USSR, it was the product of an ideology that claimed exemption from ordinary moral strictures. And though South Africa did not threaten a universalist geopolitical crusade, it did espouse a universalist ideology&mdash;of racial superiority&mdash;claiming to be the last outpost of Western civilization on the dark continent.</p>\n<p>What does the record of American conservatives look like in retrospect when it comes to South Africa? An examination of conservative periodicals, including the National Review, Commentary, and the Wall Street Journal, and columns by pundits such as George F. Will and William Safire, suggests that many American conservatives reproduced the official South African political line. Far from subjecting South Africa to critical scrutiny, they became apologists for, if not champions of, apartheid.</p>\n<p>These apologies came in several stages. Throughout, conservatives defended apartheid, but the tactical emphases shifted over the decades. During the first stage, in the 1960s, conservatives depicted blacks as racially inferior to whites and praised the homelands policy of South Africa. In the second stage, in the 1970s, conservatives painted apartheid as a necessary evil; the Soviet threat required the United States to support South Africa. In the final stage, in the 1980s, the right decried the move toward divestment and sanctions, argued that capitalism would save the country, and portrayed Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress as pawns of the Kremlin. Ultimately, the profound moral failure that took place among many leftists in facing up to the true character of Soviet totalitarianism was uncannily mirrored by the right-wing intellectual defense of apartheid.</p>\n<p>ENDORSING WHITE RULE</p>\n<p>The system of apartheid was instituted by the National Party after it won parliamentary elections in 1948. National Party members, who had been open admirers of Hitler, were determined to combat what they saw as the dangerous erosion of traditional barriers between the races in South Africa. During World War II, men and women of a variety of races had worked side by side in factories, and new cities of mixed races had emerged from the housing shortage. The Nationalists, like the Nazis, introduced legislation that progressively stripped a vulnerable minority of its legal rights. The assault was spearheaded by interior minister Hendrik Verwoerd, a former social scientist at the University of Stellenbosch, who viewed apartheid as a means of implementing his theories about race, beginning with the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 and building to the Group Areas Act in June 1950 that designated where people of different races could live. The Group Areas Act produced the homelands policy, in which blacks were presumed to flourish when confined to cordoned-off tracts of land.</p>\n<p>Until the late 1960s conservatives took two tacks. One was to repudiate comparisons of the United States with South Africa. \"Racial conditions in the U.S.,\" huffed the Wall Street Journal in a September 29, 1967, editorial, \"have about as much to do with apartheid as they do with the craters of the moon.\" The other, and more frequent, position was to depict blacks as innately inferior to whites and to laud South Africa\'s efforts on behalf of the black population.</p>\n<p>One of the first mentions of South Africa in National Review came in an editorial comment on April 23, 1960, that inquired, \"Deadend in South Africa?\" Initially, the editors defended apartheid by depicting the problem of race relations as insoluble and therefore hopeless. \"It is not a solution to assert that South Africa belongs to the blacks (who, as it happens, moved into the region after the whites),\" the editors said, \"any more than it is proper to say that the American South \'belongs\' to the white man.\" Moving along from the question of whom South Africa belonged to, the editors contended, \"the whites are entitled, we believe, to pre-eminence in South Africa.\"</p>\n<p>As National Review developed its line on South Africa, however, it sometimes soft-pedaled such uninhibited language in favor of simply posing questions about South Africa\'s ruler. In a lengthy essay appearing on January 15, 1963, William F. Buckley, Jr., projected an air of suave reasonableness. After traveling through South Africa for several weeks, he wrote that \"there has never been any reason to doubt Verwoerd\'s own sincerity. He means to help the blacks.\" Buckley went on to depict the homelands policy as a possible remedy to the ills of South Africa: \"it is an unorthodox idea, but not intrinsically preposterous, to suppose that nationhood could draw together in a meaningful political entity all the black splotches on a piebald area.\" Buckley pleaded for sympathy for the South African dilemma, observing that \"we should try at least to understand what it is they are trying to do, and deny ourselves that unearned smugness that the bigot shows.\" Similarly, National Review editorialized on December 31, 1963, that \"quite apart from whether\" the homelands \"policy is ultimately feasible, a great deal depends . . . on whether there is a sincerity of purpose there.\" And on January 10, 1967, Priscilla L. Buckley wrote that \"one has to concede the sincerity of thousands of South African men and women who are working for apartheid.\"</p>\n<p>Of course, the sincerity of the South African regime was not the issue. Criminal regimes such as the Bolsheviks can be perfectly sincere about remaking humanity, but this does not make them any less murderous. In pressing the theme of sincerity, conservatives were avoiding the issue at hand. Worse, William F. Buckley, Jr., in pleading for understanding of the South African experiment, was plunging into the bog of relativism that conservatives have always decried leftists for entering in discussing Third World despotisms.</p>\n<p>But National Review never deviated from its support for the regime. On June 11, 1964, Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Lionel Bernstein, and other members of the African National Congress (ANC) were sentenced to life in prison for terroristic activities and for being communists. At his trial, Mandela pointed out that the allegation that he was a communist had been rejected at the Treason Trials several years earlier and that while \"there has often been close cooperation between the ANC and the Communist Party . . . cooperation is merely proof of a common goal&mdash;in this case the removal of white supremacy&mdash;and is not proof of a complete community of interests.\" What Mandela might also have pointed out is that he had been initially hostile to the Communist Party; it was the refusal of the South African government to negotiate with the ANC that had led it to establish relations with the communists. For the June 30 National Review, however, the trial was an occasion for mockery. \"The South African courts have sentenced a batch of admitted terrorists to life in the penitentiary, and you would think the court had just finished barbecuing St. Joan, to hear the howls from the Liberal press.\"</p>\n<p>The notion of one-man/one-vote was just as absurd to National Review. Perhaps the most sustained exposition of right-wing thought on South Africa came in a March 9, 1965, column by conservative founding father Russell Kirk. Kirk began by making a direct link between the United States and South Africa. In the United States, he wrote, the Warren Court\'s notion of one-man/one-vote \"will work mischief&mdash;much injuring, rather than fulfilling, the responsible democracy for which Tocqueville hoped.\" But America, Kirk believed, was vigorous enough to survive such folly. South Africa was not: \"this degradation of the democratic dogma, if applied, would bring anarchy and the collapse of civilization.\" Repeating South African propaganda, Kirk maintained that blacks were not fit to govern themselves. Only a minority of the various races in South Africa, Kirk wrote, was \"civilized.\" The European \"element\" had rescued South Africa, and \"Bantu political domination would be domination by witch doctors (still numerous and powerful) and reckless demagogues.\"</p>\n<p>As the 1960s drew to a close and civil rights legislation was passed in the United States, conservatives began to devote more of their energies to fighting sanctions against South Africa. Governor George Wallace of Alabama defended apartheid in toto, declaring that if elected President he would end all sanctions against South Africa. And Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi stated in Johannesburg that he supported apartheid \"or whatever you call it.\" National Review never gave up trying to defend the homelands policy. On April 13, 1979, for instance, F. R. Buckley wrote of the \"alleged callousness\" of the Boers toward \"poor blacks\" and declared that \"Soweto cannot be held up as representing any policy of material mistreatment of blacks, nor any racially motivated indifference to their well-being.\" Like apologists for Soviet expansionism who argued that Russia had been traumatized by a history of invasions, Buckley wrote that the history of the Boers meant they had reason to be paranoid and that \"their fears are understandable.\" On October 23, 1974, the Wall Street Journal, flatly contradicting its usual anti-Soviet stance, stated that to pressure South Africa economically \"is a repudiation of the view that political and ideological differences should not be allowed to stand in the way of improving relations with such unadmirable governments as Russia, China and Cuba.\"</p>\n<p>THE RED AND THE BLACK</p>\n<p>Beginning in the late 1960s, however, conservatives shifted focus away from the homelands policy and began to concentrate instead on the Soviet threat. In January 1967, Priscilla L. Buckley stated: \"if we help bring about chaos in South Africa we will deny ourselves a vital military trump in the Indian Ocean. For South Africa to be denied to the West would be a strategic and possibly . . . a fatal disaster.\" Elspeth Huxley, writing in the August 27, 1968, issue of National Review, declared that isolating the South African regime could only backfire. Detente with the Soviet Union may have been scorned by conservatives, but suddenly it was entirely appropriate in dealing with South Africa. \"If the outside world really wants to shake apartheid,\" wrote Huxley, \"the only practical way is to sup with the devil: step up trade, increase all forms of contact . . . send out lecturers who will refrain from lecturing South Africans on how to run their own affairs.\"</p>\n<p>This is precisely the approach that the Reagan administration devised in order to forestall the growing sanctions movement against South Africa: constructive engagement. Beginning in the late 1960s, student demonstrators and social activists started targeting universities and corporations that held investments in South Africa. Organizations such as the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the Council on Economic Priorities, and the Investor Responsibility Research Center were created primarily to pressure for divestment. By 1975, the Congressional Black Caucus, led by Charles Diggs, had begun to push harder for sanctions. Perhaps the most important step was taken by the Reverend Leon Sullivan, a prominent civil rights leader, who announced his Sullivan principles in March 1977, demanding that corporations adhere to a set of conditions before investing in South Africa. Twelve multinational companies signed on right away, agreeing, among other things, to integrate their facilities, to pay blacks wages equal to whites in comparable jobs, and to move more blacks into supervisory positions. By 1985, 173 American firms had committed to the Sullivan principles. But in the late 1980s, when Sullivan declared that his own principles were not working fast enough to expedite apartheid\'s downfall, it became evident to most that sanctions were the inevitable next step.</p>\n<p>T hese moves were anathema to conservatives. Chester Crocker, the point man for the Reagan administration, espoused constructive engagement. Writing in Foreign Affairs in 1979, he stated that \"the option of U.S. disengagement hardly exists in practice. . . . By its nature and history South Africa is a part of the Western experience and an integral part of the Western economic system. In addition, the exigencies of U.S. domestic politics rule out disengagement.\" In truth, the domestic pressure that was mounting in the United States was actually for disengagement. It was conservatives who continued to support the apartheid regime in the face of growing public revulsion against it. As Crocker told a South African reporter in October 1980, \"all Reagan knows about southern Africa is that he\'s on the side of the whites.\" \"To what extent,\" asked the March 14, 1986, National Review, \"is the vast majority of South African blacks intellectually and practically prepared to assume the social, economic, and political leadership in a highly industrialized country?\"</p>\n<p>THE CAPITALIST EXCUSE</p>\n<p>By the 1980s, conservatives had apparently become Marxists. Economics was destiny. Capitalism would transform South Africa. Moral and humanitarian considerations could be dispensed with. Politics was irrelevant. Only economics counted.</p>\n<p>And so, in a curious echo of the arguments of old leftist Soviet sympathizers, conservatives maintained that while blacks might not enjoy political rights, they were prospering economically under an authoritarian regime. \"Capitalism,\" National Review editorialized on June 6, 1986, \"has been the principal lever of amelioration in the lives of black South Africans. Bishop Tutu and the shanty-of-the-week set have their program for South Africa\'s future, but there can be others.\" On August 1, 1986, William F. Buckley, Jr., advised the United States to forget about the \"one-man/one-vote business.\" George F. Will claimed that \"South Africa needs more of what sanctions would diminish. It needs foreign capital operating under the rules of foreign justice.\" Fleur de Villiers, in the Winter 1986/87 National Interest, dismissed sanctions as \"folly\" that would harm \"the black South Africans and their families who will lose their livelihood, and possibly their lives.\" Karen Elliott House argued that sanctions would have precisely the opposite effect on the ruling regime: \"America\'s political strictures and economic sanctions have simply served to harden the attitudes of those who hold power . . . and to damage the economic fortunes and futures of the great majority of South Africans caught in between.\" It was the whites, she indicated, who might be in the greatest jeopardy. \"The U.S.,\" she concluded, \"shouldn\'t participate in schemes that simply transfer power from one racial group to another, while still guaranteeing no protection for the individual&mdash;regardless of color.\" But once again, conservatives were engaging in a sleight of hand. No one had ever argued that sanctions would have no effect on blacks. The point was that pressure had to be exerted on the regime, or no progress at all would occur in the country.</p>\n<p>Conservatives also em ployed other arguments to ridicule the move toward sanctions. Liberals, conservatives said, were hypocrites. They were simply posturing, claiming a moral superiority that they didn\'t deserve. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, complained on March 10, 1978, that to \"reap domestic political benefit from the African issue, you have to be against the white racists. . . . You have to start supporting the black radicals. At the end of the day, in order to demonstrate your opposition to the racists you end up supporting the Russians.\" The Journal concluded that \"those who insist on viewing American policy in terms of the U.S. civil right struggle\" were \"throwing their support to the Black Panthers and Blackstone Rangers.\" On December 10, 1986, the Journal again drew an explicit link between the civil rights struggle in America and South Africa. The sanctions advocates, the Journal said, were not interested in reform, but, rather, revolution: \"they know the U.S. civil-rights techniques of 20 years ago, in which you pressed a little harder and got a little more. The effect in South Africa scarcely matters: the point is to enact the ritual.\" Peter L. Berger and Bobby Godsell, in a July 1987 Commentary article entitled \"Fantasies About South Africa,\" declared that \"people in the West too have used South Africa as a ventilation valve for their own moral and political frustrations, finding in it a convenient surrogate or an easy analogy for issues at home whose complexity has rendered them intractable.\"</p>\n<p>Y et another part of conservative dogma was that a liberal double standard was being practiced against South Africa. \"Gorbachev can kill as many Afghans as he likes,\" complained National Review on July 18, 1986, \"by a factor of perhaps 500 to 1 over deaths in South Africa, and no House vote imposes \'sanctions\' on him. Let\'s kick the midget.\" The August 2, 1985, Wall Street Journal opined that \"the nuclear-freeze movement having vanished from the headlines, bashing the Boers has suddenly become the approved outlet for demonstrating your own morality.\" Dinesh D\'Souza, writing in the August 20, 1985, New York Times, stated that liberals were \"preoccupied more with ideology than with people\" in their call for sanctions. He claimed that if liberals were consistent, they would apply the same arguments to South Africa that they applied to the Soviet Union: \"the South African people are not monsters, as they are often portrayed, but \'people just like us.\' \" Of course, D\'Souza failed to realize that this is exactly what conservatives were saying about South Africa.</p>\n<p>The most sustained charge of hypocrisy was developed by Adam Wolfson in the organ of the Heritage Foundation, Policy Review, in the fall of 1985. Wolfson began by making the rather obvious point that South Africa was scarcely the only country in Africa systematically to violate human rights. Ethiopia, Burundi, Angola, and Zaire were also grievous offenders. \"Americans,\" wrote Wolfson, \"who call for freedom and democratization in South Africa [should] think about the best ways of achieving these goals in the rest of the continent as well.\" Wolfson granted that the \"suppression of blacks in South Africa is in some ways more systematic than in most other African countries\" but also contended that \"in other respects, South Africa is freer than most African countries.\" In essence, the charge of hypocrisy was a recipe for inaction. The fact that other countries were violating human rights was something many liberal activists may have preferred to ignore, but conservatives were never particularly exercised about those human rights violations except in the context of defending South Africa.</p>\n<p>In the mid-1980s, conservatives became increasingly truculent in their attacks against liberals agitating for changes in American policy. And so, as sanctions were on the verge of being passed by Congress on October 2, 1986, conservative rhetoric only got hotter. Jesse Helms and Patrick Buchanan, then communications director for Reagan, vilified Bishop Desmond Tutu. William F. Buckley, Jr., groused in an op-ed on July 25, 1986, that the \"militants in South Africa will settle at this point for nothing less than The Federalist Papers, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Emancipation Proclamation, Brown vs. Board of Education, the civil-rights acts of 1964 and 1965, and the latest affirmative-action decision of the Supreme Court.\" William Safire declared on August 8 in the New York Times that \"the Big Lie being sold and swallowed in the debate on South Africa is this: If you are against sanctions, you are for apartheid.\" In August, Jerry Falwell announced his support for P. W. Botha: South Africa was \"a country that is making progress and is a friend of the West,\" he said in Pretoria. He denounced sanctions and urged \"millions of Christians to buy Krugerrands\" and \"to go into a million homes . . . to present our cause.\"</p>\n<p>B ut the cause was a losing one. By 1986, 119 colleges and universities as well as dozens of states and cities had approved some form of divestment and the California senate approved divestment from the state\'s major pension funds. When Congress passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act on October 2, conservatives went into conniptions. William F. Buckley, Jr., complained on October 8, \"We have almost guaranteed that the anti-apartheid movement within South Africa will now slow down. . . . It was always the point of Ronald Reagan, and a few others, that the anti-apartheid cause is set back, rather than advanced, by aggressive sanctions against the government of South Africa.\"</p>\n<p>While conservatives had lost the battle on sanctions, the war was not over for them. They simply moved the fight to another arena, stepping up their attempts to demonize the ANC, and relentlessly depicting Mandela as a dangerously radical communist. In the July 1988 Commentary, David Roberts, Jr., concluded that \"those American pundits and politicians who currently extol the intelligence and erudition of Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo should be reminded of how George McGovern once touted the Khmer Rouge as \'some of the best educated, most able intellectuals in Cambodia.\' \" The Wall Street Journal agreed. Condemning the ANC, the Journal stated on November 12, 1983, that \"as the ANC plays out its script to polarize South Africa, it will want P. W. Botha\'s government to make the classical error of ignoring political moderates.\"</p>\n<p>A SHAMEFUL COMPLICITY</p>\n<p>Conservatives were in a tight spot after Mandela was released to a hero\'s welcome. They found themselves on the losing side of history. Their tone became somewhat more equivocal, but the sniping never ended. After Mandela was released from prison, the Wall Street Journal continued to regard him with suspicion, noting on February 13, 1990, that his first speech in Cape Town \"failed to reassure non-ANC members that he wants reconciliation with all South Africans.\" Simon Barber, in the July 23 National Review, asked \"whether Mandela is a genuine democrat or, like so many leaders of liberation movements who have come before him, the beguiling salesman of one-party tyranny.\" In the October 1990 issue of Commentary, Joshua Muravchik wrote that Mandela\'s radical beliefs would lead his people to ruin and noted that such organizers of Mandela\'s tour through the United States as Roger Wilkins \"tilt sharply to the Left.\" Now that Mandela has proven to be a magnanimous leader, however, the conservative press has had almost no discussion of his role. Where are the articles in Commentary discussing Mandela\'s statesmanship? An embarrassed silence seems to prevail.</p>\n<p>T he truth is that not a single conservative prediction of doom has been borne out. Mandela, after spending several decades in prison, might well have emerged as an embittered, authoritarian leader intent on settling scores with the minority white populations. Conservative fears of a Marxist ANC were not entirely irrational, but it was wrong to assume that Mandela would automatically become a tyrant. This was a cozy assumption that dispensed with the need to grapple with South African realities. Conservatives were merely applying a formula to South Africa. Defying that formula, Mandela and F. W. de Klerk presided over a peaceful transition of power to the black majority. South Africa has become a true parliamentary democracy no longer based on the racist regime of apartheid.</p>\n<p>It is true that South Africa remains riven by ethnic tensions and that it could still take a sharp downward economic turn. But this is not an argument against handing over power to the black population; on the contrary, it suggests that it should have taken place even sooner. No conservative maintains, for instance, that the current debility of Russia means that communist power should have been kept in the Kremlin. As with South Africa, a good case can be made that the fewer years the communists ruled Russia, the better condition it would be in today.</p>\n<p>Indeed, every argument made by conservatives concerning apartheid has been proven wrong. Seldom has there been a more decisive repudiation of conservative dogma than in the case of South Africa. Far from being a failure, sanctions worked. The withdrawal of mressured the government itself for action. Sanctions also sapped the National Party of its confidence. After the United States and the British Commonwealth imposed sanctions, professors at the University of Stellenbosch, where apartheid had been concajor corporations and the refusal of international banks to roll over loans exerted considerable pressure on the business community inside South Africa, which then pocted, resigned from the party. The Dutch Reform Church altered its stance and decried apartheid. F. W. de Klerk has stated that \"once the taps of international capital investment and loans had been turned off, apartheid began to stare the spectre of bankruptcy in the face.\" The conservative case about apartheid was not just morally reprehensible&mdash;it was also false.</p>\n<p>Conservatives who argued that blacks were incapable of governing themselves were reminiscent of American apologists in the 1930s, who argued the same thing about the Soviet masses. Even if one had conceded that blacks were incapable of ruling themselves, it is hard to see how continued subjugation under apartheid would have much improved their situation. Nor were conservative assessments of the ANC and Nelson Mandela on the mark. The ANC has not attempted to expropriate South African businesses and Mandela has preached reconciliation rather than hatred.</p>\n<p>Exposing the conservative crusade for South Africa is not a matter of engaging in retrospective moral condemnation. Conservatives were arguing against liberals who stated that it was imperative to isolate and condemn South Africa. Liberals correctly understood that ostracizing a white ruling class that posed as an avatar of Western civilization might sap its confidence and cause it to lose its putative moral edge. Perhaps most important, liberals grasped a fundamental moral truth: The struggle for liberty and justice in South Africa, as Robert Kinloch Massie shows in his magisterial new Loosing the Bonds: The United States and South Africa in the Apartheid Years, was a direct continuation of the American struggle for civil rights. Just as conservatives were on the side of repression in the American civil rights battle, so they joined ranks with the tyrants in South Africa.</p>\n<p>Indeed, like the leftists who praised the Soviet Union, conservatives did not just defend South Africa, they often sympathized with it. In their admiration of the Soviet Union, leftists who were entranced by notions of equality refused to recognize the horrors of the Gulag. That was bad enough. And yet, the South African regime was even more morally odious, more akin in spirit to the Nazi dictatorship than the Bolshevik one. Apartheid was the first cousin of Nazism. In both the South African and Nazi regimes, an entire class of people was singled out for persecution and degradation solely on the basis of arbitrary racial categories. Remarkably, almost no attention has been devoted to the history of the conservative defense of South Africa. The silence must end. Now that apartheid has crumbled, American conservatives have an obligation to confront their shameful complicity with white-ruled South Africa.</p>'),

He became a hero to people all over the world. As South Africa\'s President, he was respected for his courage and wisdom in bringing people together to live in peace.</p>\n<p>The young Mandela</p>\n<p>Where was he born?</p>\n<p>Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918. He was later given the name Nelson by a teacher at school.</p>\n<p>He was born in the Transkei, part of South Africa. The Transkei has mountains, valleys and grasslands called savannas. On a map, you can find it in the southeast (bottom right) corner of South Africa.</p>\n<p>Growing up</p>\n<p>Mandela\'s father Henry was a chief of the Tembu people. His mother was Nosekeni Fanny. The Mandelas were related to the Tembu royal family.</p>\n<p>When Nelson was 9, his father died. He was looked after by Jongintaba Dalindyebo, who was regent (acting chief) of the Tembu.</p>\n<p>School and college</p>\n<p>Nelson went to a mission school, and then to college. He was good at school work. He also enjoyed boxing and running. At Fort Hare University, he studied law. One of his friends there was Oliver Tambo. Nelson left the university in 1939, after student protests about the way it was run.</p>\n<p>What job did he choose?</p>\n<p>Mandela\'s family had chosen a wife for him. But he did not want an arranged marriage. So he left for the city of Johannesburg.

There are also people of European and Asian backgrounds, and people of mixed race.</p>\n<p>Dutch people set up the first white colony in South Africa in 1652. Later British settlers came. Dutch farmers called themselves \'Boers\', from a Dutch word meaning \'farmers\'. They spoke a language called Afrikaans. Most other white settlers spoke English. Black people spoke Bantu languages such as isiNdebele and isiZulu.</p>\n<p>Britain and South Africa</p>\n<p>Britain took over the Dutch colony in 1815. South Africa became part of the British Empire. Gold was found in 1886. With gold and good farmland, the country was rich.</p>\n<p>But it was not peaceful. Whites and blacks fought over the land. There were wars between the Boers and the British. The Boers wanted their own country.</p>\n<p>How South Africa was ruled</p>\n<p>When Mandela was growing up, black people had little say in how South Africa was run. The government was whites-only. Most black people were poor. They worked as servants. They worked on farms, and in factories and gold mines.</p>\n<p>What was the ANC?</p>\n<p>In 1944, Nelson Mandela joined the African National Congress or ANC. The ANC wanted black South Africans to have the same human rights as whites.</p>\n<p>In 1948, the South African government made new laws to keep white people and black people apart. The new system was called \'apartheid\'.</p>\n<p>Struggle for Freedom</p>\n<p>What was apartheid?</p>\n<p>Apartheid (say A-PART-HITE) forced white and non-white people to live in separate areas. Non-white people meant black people, people from Asia and people of mixed race.</p>\n<p>A white person and a black person could not marry. Black people and white people could not share a table in a restaurant, or sit together on a bus. Black children and white children went to different schools. Sports teams were all-white or all-black, never mixed.</p>\n<p>Mandela makes a stand</p>\n<p>Mandela and Oliver Tambo set up South Africa\'s first black law firm. Poor people came to them for help.</p>\n<p>Mandela led young people in the ANC. Many white people, as well as black people, spoke out against apartheid. Mandela admired Gandhi, who had used peaceful protest in India. Perhaps peaceful protest could get rid of apartheid, without fighting?</p>\n<p>But to speak out was dangerous. In 1956, Mandela and 155 other people were arrested for treason. After a trial lasting five years, he was set free in 1961.</p>\n<p>What happened at Sharpeville?</p>\n<p>In 1960, people held a demonstration against apartheid at Sharpeville, near Johannesburg. The police shot dead 69 black people. The government blamed the ANC, and banned it.</p>\n<p>Mandela became leader of a secret army, known as Umkhonto we Sizwe or \'Spear of the Nation\'. He was hunted by the police, and had to hide and use disguises. He travelled to other countries to ask for help.</p>\n<p>Mandela goes to jail</p>\n<p>In 1961 South Africa left the Commonwealth. Millions of people in other countries supported the anti-apartheid movement. Many nations stopped trade with South Africa. Sports teams and entertainers refused to go there.</p>\n<p>Still the government refused to change. In 1962, Nelson Mandela was arrested again. He was accused of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government. In 1964, aged 46, he was given a life sentence.</p>\n<p>President Mandela</p>\n<p>Robben Island</p>\n<p>Mandela was sent to the prison on Robben Island. Other ANC leaders in prison there included Walter Sisulu. Oliver Tambo had left South Africa to live abroad.</p>\n<p>Mandela spent 18 years on Robben Island. He had to do hard labour. He was allowed one visitor every 6 months. He was later moved to another prison.</p>\n<p>Free Nelson Mandela!</p>\n<p>Mandela became the most famous prisoner in the world. He did not give up. Even the prison guards admired him.</p>\n<p>At last, in 1988, the South African government began to make changes. One change was to let black students into \'white\' universities. From around the world, the calls got louder. Free Nelson Mandela!</p>\n<p>Mandela leaves prison</p>\n<p>In 1990, South Africa\'s new President FW de Klerk set Nelson Mandela free. Mandela and de Klerk agreed: no more fighting. Mandela called on all South Africans to work together in peace.</p>\n<p>Mandela becomes President</p>\n<p>In 1991, Mandela became leader of the ANC. In the 1994 elections, all black people in South Africa were able to vote for the first time. The ANC won the election. A new government took over. In May 1994, Nelson Mandela became South Africa\'s first black president.</p>\n<p>World Statesman</p>\n<p>The rainbow nation</p>\n<p>Another famous South African, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called South Africa a \'rainbow nation\'. Nelson Mandela also spoke of it this way. Its people were of all races and colours, working together.</p>\n<p>In 1995, South Africa was host for the rugby World Cup. President Mandela wore a Springbok rugby shirt. The springbok antelope is South Africa\'s national animal. South Africa\'s rugby team, the Springboks, had been all-white. Mandela wore the shirt to help bring white and black together. Sport helped to do this.</p>\n<p>Honours and a book</p>\n<p>Mandela was welcomed around the world as a great statesman (world leader). He was given many honours.

Its effects are devastating, yet the issue is often deeply misunderstood.</p>\n<p>Dispelling these misperceptions is one of the crucial first steps towards ending child marriage once and for all. Below, UNFPA addresses ten of the biggest myths about the practice, its causes and its consequences.</p>\n<p>Myth 1: Child marriage is rare.</p>\n<p>Child marriage is actually quite common. About 1 in 3 girls in the developing world are married before age 18.</p>\n<p>New estimates from UNFPA show that this year alone, 13.5 million children &ndash; most of them girls &ndash; will be married before they turn 18. About 4.4 million of them will be married before they turn 15. This equals 37,000 child marriages each day.</p>\n<p>Myth 2: It only happens in Muslim/African/poor countries.</p>\n<p>Actually, child marriage takes place all over the world, across continents, cultures and religions. It even happens in wealthy Western countries &ndash; including the United States and United Kingdom. But it is much more common in the developing world because one of the main driving factors is poverty.</p>\n<p>In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, 10 per cent of girls are child brides. In the Arab States, 19 per cent of girls are. In other regions, the number rises as high as 43 per cent.</p>\n<p>The majority of child marriages take place in Asia and the Pacific, the most populous region. There, about 40 million girls are child brides.</p>\n<p>Myth 3: It only happens to girls.</p>\n<p>It is true that the vast majority of child marriages involve girls. But boys can be married off, just as girls are. Estimates from UNICEF suggest that about 18 per cent of those married before age 18 are boys, while about 82 per cent are girls.</p>\n<p>Myth 4: Ending child marriage means interfering in other countries&rsquo; affairs. They should decide for themselves.</p>\n<p>Countries around the world have decided &ndash; that child marriage is a grave violation of human rights.</p>\n<p>Child marriage is prohibited by two of the most broadly endorsed human rights agreements in the world, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Together, these treaties have been signed or ratified by every country except one. And the outlier, South Sudan, has taken steps to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>\n<p>The problem persists not because governments support child marriage but because of continuing poverty and gender inequality.</p>\n<p>Myth 5: Only monsters would allow their daughters to be married off as children.</p>\n<p>It can be hard to imagine why someone would choose to have their child married off. But for millions of people, child marriage can seem like the best &ndash; or only &ndash; option.</p>\n<p>Impoverished parents, for example, often believe marriage will secure a daughters&rsquo; future by making another family responsible for her care. And parents in humanitarian crises, where sexual violence is rampant, may see child marriage as a way to protect their daughters. In fact, child marriage rates have been known to skyrocket during the chaos of war.</p>\n<p>Myth 6: So this is really a family matter, right?</p>\n<p>The consequences of child marriage don&rsquo;t stay in the family. They affect whole societies and countries.</p>\n<p>Child brides are more likely to become pregnant before their bodies are mature, increasing the risks of maternal and newborn death. Child brides are also much more likely to drop out of school &ndash; a waste of their potential &ndash; and their own children tend to be less healthy and less educated.</p>\n<p>This takes a cumulative toll on communities, workforces and economies, and the loss is carried over generations.</p>\n<p>Myth 7: These girls must be completely helpless.</p>\n<p>Actually, girls can play a huge role in ending child marriage &ndash; when they know their rights and have access to the right information and opportunities.</p>\n<p>For example, through UNFPA&rsquo;s Action for Adolescent Girls programme, girls in 12 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America are learning about their human rights. These include their right to dignity, their right to education and health, their right to live free of abuse and coercion, and their right to choose, as adults, whether and whom to marry.</p>\n<p>Girls in the programme also receive key information and services, including comprehensive sexuality education and life skills training. They receive health services and participate in savings groups, which help them become financially literate. With these skills and services, girls often become empowered to stand up for themselves.</p>\n<p>Girls equipped with this knowledge and skills have persuaded their families to delay or cancel engagements. Many have been inspired to become advocates and leaders in their communities. When people begin to see healthy, educated, safe and unmarried adolescent girls as the new normal, it can change perceptions and expectations about child marriage.</p>\n<p>Myth 8: Only harsh penalties can end this practice.</p>\n<p>Most countries have already enacted strong laws against child marriage. While it is true that these laws need better enforcement, laws alone cannot end child marriage.</p>\n<p>When parents fear for their daughters&rsquo; safety, better security is needed. Gender equality must be advanced. And extreme poverty, which drives so many child marriages, must be eradicated. For this, many changes are needed, including social safety nets for girls and their families, as well as improved access to education, health services and economic opportunities.</p>\n<p>Myth 9: This issue doesn&rsquo;t affect me.</p>\n<p>When the potential of a third of all girls in the developing world is undermined, everyone is affected. The loss of their collective potential is immeasurably huge, and it touches every economy and workforce in the world.</p>\n<p>Try to imagine a world where tens of millions more girls are educated, healthy and empowered, where every community benefits from the full bloom of their creativity and resourcefulness. Because of child marriage, their ideas, abilities and solutions are lost to all of us.</p>\n<p>Myth 10: There&rsquo;s nothing I can do about child marriage.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to help end child marriage, from supporting programmes that advocate for human rights, girls&rsquo; empowerment and youth leadership, to raising one\'s voice about the issue.</p>\n<p>Bringing these issues to the attention of the public and global leaders can help make them an international priority. Young people can &ndash; and are &ndash; sharing their concerns about such issues through the #ShowYourSelfie campaign, which will be presented to world leaders at the 2015 United Nations General Assembly. Show your support for ending child marriage by sharing your selfie with the hashtag #IDONT.</p>'),

India, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and the Gulf countries will meet the later deadline.</p>\n<p>They refused the earlier date because they have fast-expanding middle classes who want air conditioning in their hot climates, and because India feared damaging its growing industries.</p>\n<p>\"Last year in Paris, we promised to keep the world safe from the worst effects of climate change. Today, we are following through on that promise,\" said U.N. environment chief Erik Solheim in a statement, referring to 2015\'s Paris climate talks.</p>\n<p>GAINING MOMENTUM</p>\n<p>The deal binding 197 nations crowns a wave of measures to help fight climate change this month. Last week, the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate-warming emissions passed its required threshold to enter into force after India, Canada and the European Parliament ratified it.</p>\n<p>But unlike the Paris agreement, the Kigali deal is legally binding, has very specific timetables and has an agreement by rich countries to help poor countries adapt their technology.</p>\n<p>A quick reduction of HFCs could be a major contribution to slowing climate change, avoiding perhaps 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 Fahrenheit) of a projected rise in average temperatures by 2100, scientists say.</p>\n<p>Environmental groups had called for an ambitious agreement on cutting HFCs to limit the damage from the roughly 1.6 billion new air conditioning units expected to come on stream by 2050, reflecting increased demand from an expanding middle class in Asia, Latin America and Africa.</p>\n<p>Benson Ireri, a senior policy adviser at aid group Christian Aid, said that all African countries had volunteered for the earlier deadline because they worried about global warming pushing more of their citizens into poverty.</p>\n<p>\"It was a shame that India and a handful of other countries chose a slower time frame for phasing down HFCs but the bulk of nations, including China, have seen the benefits of going for a quicker reduction. It&rsquo;s also been encouraging to see small island states and African countries a part of this higher ambition group,\" he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>A scientific panel advising the signatories to the deal said phasing out HFCs will cost between $4 billion and $6 billion, said Manoj Kumar Singh, India\'s joint secretary at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.</p>\n<p>\"The implementation starts from 2024 onwards so there is enough time to plan and mobilize finance,&rdquo; he told Reuters.</p>\n<p>Donors had already put $80 million in a fund to start implementing the agreement, said Gina McCarthy, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\n<p>But Sergey Vasiliev, the head of the Russian delegation, said Russia\'s estimates of the costs were higher and argued countries\' contributions to a multilateral fund to help poor countries adapt their technology should be voluntary.</p>\n<p>The details of the funding will be finalised at a later meeting.</p>\n<p>\"We think it is more than $10 billion and some experts estimated up to $20 billion,&rdquo; he told Reuters.</p>\n<p>The HFC talks build on the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which succeeded in phasing out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), widely used at that time in refrigeration and aerosols.</p>\n<p>The protocol contains provisions for noncompliance, ranging from the provision of technical and financial assistance to trade sanctions in ozone depleting substances, which will be widened to include HFCs.</p>\n<p>The original aim of the Montreal Protocol was to stop the depletion of the ozone layer, which shields the planet from ultraviolet rays linked to skin cancer and other conditions.</p>\n<p>That effort cost $3.5 billion over 25 years, said Stephen Olivier Andersen, the director of research at Washington-based think tank Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development. Scientists say it prevented 2 million cases of skin cancer.</p>'),

Girls who are married as children are more likely to be out of school, suffer domestic violence, contract HIV/AIDS and die due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth.

Among these commitments, leaders pledged to promote the resilience of vulnerable communities to climate-related disasters; an innovative UNFPA programme will play a key role in these efforts.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Never before have so many leaders gathered to commit to action on climate change,&rdquo; said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at the close of the summit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We heard how strengthening resilience &ndash; both climate and financial &ndash; is a smart and essential investment,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>But to strengthen communities&rsquo; resilience, experts must first identify where the most vulnerable communities are and why they are vulnerable. Then, &ldquo;user-friendly &lsquo;news you can use&rsquo; climate information&rdquo; must be made available to countries, Mr. Ban said in his chair&rsquo;s summary.</p>\n<p>UNFPA has developed a tool that allows experts, policymakers and even community members themselves to see exactly where vulnerable people are and what conditions make them vulnerable.</p>\n<p>DECA</p>\n<p>The most marginalized groups are too often invisible to policymakers. Whole communities may be left voiceless, such as indigenous communities or slum-dwellers. And within communities, certain individuals and families &ndash; such as adolescent girls and female-headed households &ndash; face heightened risks.</p>\n<p>Demographic Exploration for Climate Adaptation (DECA) combines population data &ndash; including gender, age, location, housing, and availability of services &ndash; with geographic information on areas vulnerable to climate impacts.</p>\n<p>DECA &ndash; developed by UNFPA in partnership with the International Institute for Environment and Development and Wolfram Research &ndash; is a central part of the Climate Information Action Statement, a plan developed for the Climate Summit that has already garnered support from variety of nations.</p>\n<p>During the summit, for example, United States senior science adviser John Holdren announced the US had signed onto the Climate Information Action Statement, part of the country&rsquo;s broader commitment, announced by US President Obama, to &ldquo;deploy the unique scientific and technological capabilities of the United States, from climate data to early warning systems&hellip; to help vulnerable nations better prepare for weather-related disasters and better plan for long-term threats like steadily rising seas.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Climate Information Action Statement calls for &ldquo;the integration of climate information with other data into development planning.&rdquo; DECA enables exactly this kind of informed decision-making.</p>\n<p>A detailed picture</p>\n<p>DECA provides information and analysis with a high degree of resolution.</p>\n<p>The programme is able to reveal, for example, which densely populated neighbourhoods lie in the flood-prone areas of Semarang, a city in Indonesia. Within these hazard zones, the programme can show which neighbourhoods have large populations of women and girls.</p>\n<p>Women and girls tend to be disproportionately affected by such crises. During the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, for example, women died in far higher numbers than men. After disasters, women and girls face risks of gender-based violence, and require specific interventions &ndash; including hygiene supplies, maternal care and safe delivery services.</p>\n<p>DECA also shows the resources, services and infrastructure in climate-exposed areas.</p>\n<p>All of this data can be used to tailor disaster response plans to the needs of vulnerable populations, and it can be used to plan more sustainable infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Scaling up to cover more people</p>\n<p>Multiple countries, including Indonesia, Maldives, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago have committed to using DECA in planning and policy development.</p>\n<p>By the end of 2015, DECA will cover as many as 20 million people, and it could cover significantly more. DECA is based on the 2010 round of censuses, which counted and mapped more than 90 percent of the world&rsquo;s population; the programme&rsquo;s scale-up potential is therefore enormous.</p>\n<p>Primary funding for the project comes from the Government of Luxembourg, with additional funding for the project&rsquo;s work in the Maldives coming from the Government of Denmark.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We must empower people to determine the course of their lives, to generate the innovations that will address climate change and other challenges, and to devise the policies that will advance us collectively into sustainability.&rdquo;</p>'),

Brazil, which has the world&rsquo;s fifth largest population, has become a major source of revenue growth for a company that generates 92% of its business outside the US. And the method Tupperware uses to make sure its success in Brazil stays on track? Keeping its sellers&rsquo; husbands happy.</p>\n<p>Tupperware&rsquo;s sales strategy depends on direct selling. The company gives women micro-loans to purchase their food storage and other kitchen-related products, which the women then demonstrate and sell to their social networks. If they are successful, they move up to become unit managers, supervising other saleswomen and eventually, if they continue to do well, they become distributors who oversee several unit managers. While turnover in the first rank of the salesforce is very high, Goings acknowledges, turnover for distributors is only around 10%.</p>\n<p>The direct sales model can be particularly attractive to Brazilian women. Sexual harassment in the workplace and domestic abuse are rampant in Brazil, says Brodwyn Fischer, professor of Latin American history and director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Chicago. While there is an idealized image for the poor and lower middle class in Brazil that men work and take care of their wives, women who are in those classes have always had to work in order to make ends meet, Fischer says. Direct selling, especially at the initial levels, is seen as &ldquo;women&rsquo;s money&rdquo; and not an official job that would threaten a man&rsquo;s position, Fischer explains. It can allow women to become financially independent and help the household but in a way that does not require them to keep regular business hours or leave the house all the time.</p>\n<p>Tupperware has worked to be sensitive to that gender dynamic, with the company making sure to find a role for the husbands of women who have climbed the ladder to become major distributors. For a company whose pitch is the empowerment of women &ndash; Goings himself is part of the UN Women&rsquo;s HeForShe initiative &ndash; the CEO spends a lot of time focusing on the needs of men.</p>\n<p>Tupperware encourages the husbands of women who become successful distributors for the company to take on roles in the administration and operations of their wives&rsquo; distributor networks. As the women become more financially successful and their confidence grows, Tupperware spends &ldquo;a lot of time trying to teach them how to carry it well, to be sensitive to the dynamic of the husband&rdquo;, Goings explains. When the top distributors go on a company-sponsored trip, the husbands come with them, the company will include photos of both the husband and wife on promotional materials, and when the women are invited on stage at company events, the husbands are on stage with them, Goings says. Reversing an old saying, Goings says that &ldquo;behind these dynamic, successful women is a man&rdquo;. Most men adjust to their wife&rsquo;s success, says Goings, as their own quality of life improves, and he credits the women&rsquo;s new financial independence with lowering instances of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>Tupperware, and fellow American direct selling company Avon, are not the only ones finding success by tapping into the motivated female population of the country who are looking for other ways to earn money. Direct selling is actually not new in Brazil. In fact, a local company, Natura, that makes soaps, perfumes and other natural products, already counts an astonishing 1.9 million Brazilians among its direct selling workforce. Entrepreneurship of any kind is attractive to women in Brazil, says Fischer, in part because it means women don&rsquo;t have to deal with workplace sexism, which is prevalent, and also means women can run their business the way they see fit and pay themselves, eliminating any wage gap. The informality of a direct selling job that does not depend on either the government or a company directly for regular employment also fits into Brazilian history of stringing together work to put food on the table, Fischer says.</p>\n<p>While Brazil is currently in the throes of an economic recession as well as political unrest, and just in August impeached President Dilma Rousseff, Tupperware continues to see sales growth. Goings credits Brazilians&rsquo; culture of optimism, their lack of confidence in their government, and their large population of young people open to entrepreneurship as part of the reason for Tupperware&rsquo;s success. Brazilians, Goings says, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t sit on their hands waiting for the government to come up with programs&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Goings is a huge believer in the entrepreneurial spirit of the young. He can cite statistics on millennial entrepreneurial behaviors and gets excited talking about self-reliance. It all goes back to his theories of work and government. Goings believes that the lack of confidence in the government and belief in entrepreneurship as the way to economic independence that he sees in Brazil is something &ldquo;you are going to see repeated over and over in the world. I believe that Brazil could be a vanguard of what a new template could look like for individuals taking responsibility for improvement for life in their hands,&rdquo; Goings explains.</p>\n<p>When it comes to governments in Europe, &ldquo;you are dealing with governments that are going broke&rdquo;, he says, and the current political climate in the US is an indicator of things gone wrong, he explains, adding: &ldquo;I hope what comes together is more people that get an attitude that we have to figure out these answers ourselves as individuals.&rdquo;</p>'),

Nicaragua</strong> (12th in global ranking) remains the best performer of the region for the fourth year in a row despite dropping six places from 2014 to 2015. It has closed the gender gap fully for educational attainment and health and survival. Furthermore, it is the highest-ranking country of the region and fourth in the world for political empowerment, with more than 50% of the gender gap now closed. Since 2006, the country is the world&rsquo;s most improved on the overall index, the second most improved of the region, and third most improved of the world&nbsp;for political empowerment.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Bolivia</strong> (22) moves up 36 places from last year, making it the second best performer of the region, with nearly 75% of the gender gap now closed. This is mostly due to an increase on the political empowerment score, resulting from a doubling of women in parliament (from 25% to 53%). The country is now the second highest ranked country in the region on the political empowerment subindex, with 42% of the gender gap now closed. On the health and survival subindex it has fully closed its gender gap, but on educational attainment it is the region&rsquo;s second worst performer. Since 2006, the country has been the world&rsquo;s most improved country on political empowerment and second most improved on the overall index. It is also the second most improved of the region on the health and survival subindex.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Barbados</strong> (24) moves up nine&nbsp;places from last year, overtaking Cuba, Ecuador and Argentina on the regional rankings. This is mostly due to an increase in economic participation and opportunity, resulting from a rise in the number of female legislators, senior officials and managers as well as professional and technical workers. It is now the best performing country of the region and second in the world on this subindex. It has also fully closed its health and survival gender gap. Within the region, it scores above average on all subindexes except political empowerment.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Cuba</strong> (29) moves up one spot from last year. This is partly due to an increase in the number of women in ministerial positions (from 23% to 31%). It has nearly closed the gender gap for education&nbsp;and ranks third in the region on political empowerment,&nbsp;with 40% of the gender gap now closed.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Ecuador</strong> (33) has regressed since last year, dropping 12 places in rank. This is partly due to a slight decrease in the female-to-male ratio of estimated earned income. In health and survival, it has fully closed the gender gap. When compared to 2006, it is the second most improved country in the region and the fourth most improved of the world&nbsp;for economic participation and opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Argentina</strong> (35) has slightly progressed since last year despite dropping four places in rank. This is due to a slight increase on the political empowerment subindex, resulting from more women in ministerial positions and an additional year with a female head of state. It has fully closed its gender gap for health and survival. Since 2006 it has improved across all four&nbsp;areas&nbsp;except educational attainment, where there has been no change in score.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Costa Rica </strong>(38) has improved over last year and moves up 10 places with 73% of the gender gap now closed. This is due to a near doubling of women in ministerial positions (from 25% to 41%). It has also fully closed its gender gap on educational attainment, but ranks among the bottom three in the region on health and survival. Since 2006, it has improved in all subindexes except health and survival,&nbsp;where it has slightly regressed</p>\n<p><strong>8. Bahamas&nbsp;</strong>(40) drops five places since last year but slightly increased its score. It has closed the gender gap fully on the educational attainment and health and survival subindexes, and is the second best performing country in the region on economic participation and opportunity, with more than 82% of the gender gap now closed.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Colombia</strong> (42) has progressed compared to last year, moving up 11 places in rank. This is due to improvements in wage equality for similar work and estimated earned income. It is now the third best performing country in the region for economic participation and opportunity, with more than 74% of the gender gap now closed. Since 2006, it has made almost no improvement on health and survival,&nbsp;and on political empowerment, while it has actually regressed on educational attainment.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Panama </strong>(44)&nbsp;made slight progress over last year, with more women in parliament. Panama has also&nbsp;fully closed the&nbsp;gender gap on health and survival&nbsp;in 2015.

Women Executive Director Michelle Bachelet and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who gathered in Lima, Peru, to explore how to achieve gender equality in the labor markets.</p>\n<p>The study, which also examines wage differences across ethnic minorities of the region, points out that, although the average gender wage gap decreased from 25 percent to 17 percent between 1992 and 2007, the disparity remains quite high and there is still plenty of work to be done.</p>\n<p>According to the household surveys, women hold only 33 percent of the better-paid professional jobs in the region, which include those related to architecture, law or engineering. In these professions, the wage gap between men and women is significantly higher: 58 percent on average. These jobs require quantitative skills, and despite women&rsquo;s progress in education&mdash;leading men by half a year of education on average&mdash;they tend to focus on careers like psychology, teaching or nursing, where those skills are not developed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In terms of women&rsquo;s participation in the work force, there has been progress in recent decades, but the wage gap between men and women still prevails. The process of closing this gap has been very slow because misguided stereotypes and perceptions of the roles of men and women have distorted interactions, not only in the workplace but also at home. These stereotypes, which arise even in early childhood, discourage women, thus limiting their access to careers with a better future in the labor market,&rdquo; explains Hugo &Ntilde;opo, an IDB specialist in education and author of this study.</p>\n<p>Women have a tendency to work part-time, on a self-employed basis and in informal activities. While one in every ten men works part-time, one in every four women works on this basis. This labor flexibility, which allows women to participate in labor markets while still being able to take care of multiple responsibilities at home, comes at a cost reflected in lower wages.</p>\n<p>Likewise, women usually enter the labor market at a later stage and participate in it irregularly, on account of raising children, for example. This might deter their experience and professional development, thus increasing the wage gap with age.</p>\n<p>What needs to be done?</p>\n<p>In order to close the gender wage gap, the study recommends distributing household chores equally and encourages women to study science and mathematics and to take measures that give them a better chance to participate in labor markets. The latter can be exemplified with the expansion of services for early childhood development centers. Not only could this help women to increase their working day, passing from part-time to full-time employment, but it could also increase human capital for the next generation.</p>\n<p>An equal maternity leave for both parents could help level the playing field with respect to decisions of hiring women and men. Furthermore, it could encourage men and women to dedicate more time to their newborns, generating more equal decisions.</p>\n<p>Ethnic minorities in comparison to white and mixed-race majorities</p>\n<p>The book also presents a regional and country-specific outlook of the wage penalties faced by ethnic minorities in Ecuador, Chile, Paraguay, Guatemala, Brazil, Peru and Bolivia. For these groups, the gaps are even bigger than those related to gender. Guatemala and Paraguay show the highest ethnic income gaps: 68 percent and 60 percent, respectively. According to the study, the challenge for this population group must be even greater because of the high level of occupational and hierarchical segregation, as well as the lower educational achievement of these minorities, among other measures.</p>'),

From the looks of it, the wage gap between women and men in Latin America is alarming.</p>\n<p>This was the central message of a new report released this week by several United Nations agencies (the International Labor Organization, the Economic Commission on Latin America, the United Nations Development Program and the Food and Agricultural Organizations) focusing on the women&rsquo;s wage gap and other labor issues involving women.</p>\n<p>Decent Work and Gender Equality discusses how development is compromised by &ldquo;gender inequalities that are a direct consequence of traditional views on the place and role that women should occupy in society&mdash;views based on prejudice, discrimination and disregard for the progress the region has made and its effects on societies. Societies must set out to become more inclusive and egalitarian in order to overcome.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While women&rsquo;s economic status varies from country to country in the Americas, one feature in every country studied was that there are also huge inequalities among women themselves.</p>\n<p>Women earn between 60 percent and 90 percent of men&rsquo;s average income. At the same time, the percentage of women heads of households grew from 22 percent in 1990 to 31 percent in 2008, according to the United Nations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, women in the region dedicate a greater share of time than men to unremunerated activities that are characteristic of transitional roles &ndash; 86 percent in Guatemala, 81 percent in Costa Rica, and 74 percent in Mexico and Uruguay, according to a World Bank report on gender.</p>\n<p>In Latin America and the Caribbean, women&rsquo;s experiences and prospects differ greatly based on their ethnicity (e.g. indigenous or Afro-descendant), their age (young or elderly), where they live (urban or rural areas), their citizenship status (residents of their own country or migrants) and whether or not they have children.</p>\n<p>It is noteworthy that in the United States, Afro American and Latino women are still earning less than white women, although overall there is still a pay gap between males and females of all ages.</p>\n<p>In the last decade there has been a mass incorporation of women into the formal workforce in Latin America and the Caribbean, with more than 100 million women now working It has been one of the most dramatic social changes in the region.</p>\n<p>The Kinds of Jobs Women are doing</p>\n<p>In spite of a tremendous increase in the number of women participating in the workforce in Latin America women still face wage discrimination in all sectors of employment.</p>\n<p>The report noted that women were especially relegated to jobs in the informal sector. According to this study 54 percent of all women across the region were in this sector, compared to only 48 percent of all men.</p>\n<p>Being in underpaying and menial jobs reflects certain trends, such as greater urbanization and fewer opportunities for girls and women to have access to education.</p>\n<p>The higher barriers to employment for women &ndash; lack of education, isolation in rural communities with fewer jobs available &ndash; result in more women left the national economy of so many countries. Women are twice as likely as men to be unpaid workers.</p>\n<p>In addition, women are still stuck in jobs that do not pay a wage, meaning that work is more informal and unprotected, especially when women are family workers.</p>\n<p>How to Overcome the Women&rsquo;s Wage Gap</p>\n<p>So what can be done to overcome what this study calls the undervaluing of women&rsquo;s work?</p>\n<p>Ministries of Labor and the Women&rsquo;s Commissions throughout the region must work to build a more just set of conditions for income equality for women.</p>\n<p>The researchers noted that women in Latin America are not alone in this situation. Globally, women in the workforce are still heavily concentrated in the low-income occupations and even in jobs that pay less than the minimum wage.</p>\n<p>But it is also important to note that the types of solutions to the problems of underpayment or informal sector work must be overcome through policies by governments that promote pay equity as part of broader social policies on economic inclusion.</p>\n<p>It also means that both local and national governments will need to emphasize the connection between expanding educational opportunities and access to a better quality of life.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the study suggests that policies that permit freedom to create and sustain labor unions, and the right to collective bargaining can benefit women workers. Health insurance, social security and other services that allow women to remain active during their productive years can also help.</p>\n<p>A finding the report highlighted was that workers of both sexes see a rise in income with years of education. The women&rsquo;s wage gap has narrowed because of the higher earnings of women with more educational credentials.</p>\n<p>This is important as it demonstrates the overwhelming importance of secondary and higher education for women wage earners. Yet for too many women in the region access to higher education is still more difficult because of economic barriers. In rural areas the challenge is getting a primary school education.</p>\n<p>Latin America and the Caribbean faces a critical moment in terms of setting in place protection regimes and programs that help eliminate wage discrimination against women.</p>\n<p>But creating new laws, let alone enforcing them, will be something that each country needs to ensure higher growth rates. If women remain at the bottom of the earning ladder progress in the decades ahead will be compromised.</p>\n<p>This is especially significant since the Americas is a less conflictive region with a growing middle class that has helped to ensure a better futures for its citizens than many other parts of the global south.</p>\n<p>What is possible is for countries to adopt international legal norms to their particular women&rsquo;s income gap issues. The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women or CEDAW (1979) can help end employment discrimination. All Latin American and Caribbean states ratified it.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Inter&ndash;American Program on the Promotion of Women&rsquo;s Human Rights and Gender Equity and Equality, prepared by the Inter-American Commission on Women in 1998 to urge member states to ensure women have full and equal access to work and productive resources.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Brasilia Consensus of 2010 includes the recognition of women&rsquo;s unpaid domestic work and care giving; it recommends legislation that extends rights to female domestic workers as it does to other workers, and also guarantees equal pay for equal work.</p>\n<p>These form a good starting point for better protections and improved public policy that can help promote equality. The choice should be obvious if nations want to grow and prosper. Economic growth cannot be accomplished when one half of the workforce is held back.</p>\n<p>If the progress of the early 21st century is to continue then gender must be factored into all national decisions related to expanding and maintaining a productive workforce.</p>'),

But analysts say China\'s cyber operations are an active threat.</p>\n<p>\"Military intelligence has rapidly moved from cloak-and-dagger to bits-and-bytes over the last fifteen years... and China\'s no exception to that,\" says Bryce Boland, Asia-Pacific CTO of FireEye, a cybersecurity firm.</p>\n<p>\"China has been developing its capabilities within the PLA for a number of years, going back at least a decade. And their capabilities have now also been brought together into a single, strategic organization that is essentially a new branch of the military.\"</p>\n<p>Shift in behavior</p>\n<p>China is of course not the only actor in this era of cyber warfare.</p>\n<p>But it has taken a significant step forward with the United States to establish some ground rules in a new domain of conflict with no widely-held norms.</p>\n<p>During President Xi Jinping\'s state visit to the US last year, the China and the US formally agreed not to conduct or knowingly support economic cyber-espionage.</p>\n<p>\"I think China, after that, has tried to comply with that agreement,\" says Tong Zhao of the Beijing-based Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.</p>\n<p>\"China increasingly realizes it is in China\'s interests to promote a rule-based system.\"</p>\n<p>And since the agreement, FireEye has observed a significant change in Chinese cyber activity.</p>\n<p>\"We\'ve seen a shift in behavior since the Obama-Xi agreement. And that shift in behavior has resulted in a decrease in attacks against US and Western organizations for the purposes of stealing their intellectual property,\" says Boland.</p>\n<p>\"We\'ve almost seen a pivot towards Asia. We\'ve seen more targeted attacks now focused on information gathering and intelligence collection from countries on the periphery of China -- anyone with a land boundary or involved in a maritime dispute. And that kind of activity is much more focused on intelligence.\"</p>\n<p>China\'s cyber-spies target Asia</p>\n<p>China\'s cyber-spies are pivoting away from stealing US trade secrets as they move towards gathering intelligence in a region fraught with geopolitical tension.</p>\n<p>Take Taiwan, for instance.</p>\n<p>Relations with Taipei and Beijing have been tense since the landslide election of Tsai Ing-Wen, Taiwan\'s first female president. Her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has traditionally leaned in favor of formal independence from China.</p>\n<p>After the DPP\'s election win, its website was compromised and replaced with a spoofed site to collect data on visitors.</p>\n<p>And then, there\'s Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>Two years after Hong Kong\'s pro-democracy \"Umbrella Movement,\" the city\'s first legislative elections since the mass demonstrations provided a platform for a small but vocal independence movement -- much to the chagrin of Beijing.</p>\n<p>Before the election, two Hong Kong government agencies were targeted by cyber-attackers using new malware tools.</p>\n<p>According to FireEye, both incidents were the work of Chinese state-sponsored hackers.</p>\n<p>\"We know those that those attacks were originated from China... they were clearly politically motivated attacks,\" says Boland.</p>\n<p>\"The only logical consequence is that they are operated by a group of people who had a political activity to conduct, so we believe they were state-sponsored.\"</p>\n<p>Not all attacks officially sanctioned</p>\n<p>But not all hack attacks originating from China have the official red seal of approval.</p>\n<p>After an international court ruled that China did not have a historic right to a disputed area in the South China Sea, flight information screens at Vietnam\'s two biggest airports were hacked to show messages criticizing the Philippines and Vietnam and their territorial claims in the region.</p>\n<p>Analyst Tong Zhao is convinced that the Vietnam airport hack was not the work of Chinese state agents.</p>\n<p>\"We used to assume that China is a country having a very centralized political system -- the central government must be in control of everything. I think that assumption is inaccurate,\" Zhao says.</p>\n<p>And he\'s right. As powerful as it may be, China is not a single monolith.

The North\'s plutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile.</p>\n<p>Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy.</p>\n\n<h4>What else do we know about the North\'s nuclear programme?</h4>\n<p>South Korean protesters hold pictures of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during an anti-North Korea rally against recent missile launches and provocative acts, on the birthday of its founder, Kim Il Sung, in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, 15 April 2014Image copyrightAP</p>\n<p>The Yongbyon site is thought to be its main nuclear facility, while the January and September 2016 tests were said to have been carried out at the Punggye-ri site.</p>\n<p>The Yongbyon site processes spent fuel from power stations and has been the source of plutonium for North Korea\'s nuclear weapons programme.</p>\n<p>Both the US and South Korea have also said that they believe the North has additional sites linked to a uranium-enrichment programme.

However, attacks such as those conducted by pirates in the Arabian Sea and off the eastern edge of Africa, among other events, have brought to light the importance of law reform pertaining to safety of water travel. Through what groups should the sanctity of waterways be preserved? Where should the funding for protection of international waters, if any, come from? What role do Exclusive Economic Zones play in this decision? Delegates in Legal will be faced with the multiple facets of this problem and seek to address them with both efficacy and efficiency.</p>','Reforming Peacekeeping','<p>Given the often complicated and difficult situation into which UN Peacekeepers are placed, it is clear that Peacekeeping missions must be handled quite delicately and with a high degree of diligence. In addition, stagnant amounts of both physical and human capital for these missions are causing them to run into even more problems, and in some cases prevent the UN from sending out certain missions at all. How will the safety of Peacekeepers be ensured, and how can the number of Peacekeepers and their available resources be significantly increased, especially considering the importance the Free Rider problem plays in this issue?

Within this body, each member state has one vote. The General Assembly can convene a UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on topics that feel most pressing to the member states. In particular, in both 1998 and 2009, the UN held Special Sessions on drugs and narco-trafficking, where they attempted to address the growing drug problem throughout the world. As such, as a General Assembly \"committee,\" we are responsible for non-binding recommendations made to member states, without the enforcement mechanism of the Security Council; so keep this in mind when drafting potential resolutions. Despite a decades-long drug war, narcotics continue to be smuggled across borders all over the world. Columbian cocaine still pours into Mexico and the United States, while Afghani heroin spreads across Asia and Europe, contributing to the growing world heroin epidemic. Narcotics Trade and Smuggling is not only responsible for the destruction of countless lives of those affected by drug addiction, but also empowers criminal organizations around the world. Drug cartels gruesomely battle for territory and smuggling routes, leading to the destruction of numerous communities. As such, how does your country plan to reduce the rates of narcotics smuggling? Do you plan to directly target the power of the cartels, or do you see alternative solutions? Make sure to emphasize how your nation has been affected by the illicit narcotics trade.</p>','Legalization of Addictive Substances','<p>Since the dawn of the \"War on Drugs,\" the legal abolition and stringent sentencing laws placed on substance abusers has reigned supreme. Though laws, sentencing reviews, and jurisdiction of addictive substances range throughout the world, with extremes in both directions, the time has come to better contextualize and define the legality of addictive substances. With the illegal intercontinental drug trade ruled throughout the world by sophisticated and powerful drug cartels, the UN General Assembly Special Session on Drugs has a unique and meaningful role in curbing the harm that this drug trade has on society at large. Delegates within the committee should ultimately discuss whether the legalization of addictive substances is the right path to take in order to curb their harms on society. The delegates must ultimately propose a framework by which to better contextualize these addictive substances for years to come.</p>','','','','','/static/docs/bg2016/ILMUNCIndia2016-Special.png','/static/docs/bg2016/ILMUNCIndia2016-Special.pdf',1385,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,'','Delegates of SSOD, I cannot express how impressed I was by committee over the course of this weekend.

I first got involved with Model United Nations my freshman year, participated throughout high school, and am now a member of Penn\'s International Affairs Association. I serve as the Director of Operations for UPMUNC 50, the legendary college counterpart to the equally awesome ILMUNC. Some of my other interests include longboarding, Hip-Hop, Classical Arabic, getting lost in the city, and reading bad Yelp reviews.</p>\n<p>In the months leading up to conference, please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions regarding ILMUNC India or Penn. I look forward to meeting everyone in the fall!</p>\n','','','','Attacks on Healthcare Workers','<p>Healthcare services are most necessary in conflict situations but are also most vulnerable to attack in such situations. Millions of people around the world are restricted from adequate access to health services by violence and threats against healthcare facilities and workers. Targeted attacks on doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, paramedics, and other medical personnel by both state and non-state militant actors severely undermine and sometimes destroy health infrastructure in already unstable areas. These disruptions cut off entire communities from receiving essential services, such as vaccinations and maternity care, as healthcare workers are forced to flee the areas where they are most needed. In recent years, attacks on and interference with healthcare have been increasingly condemned as violations of the right to health, yet impunity for attacks still remains the status quo in many cases. Therefore, violence against healthcare workers, facilities, and vehicles is an issue with widespread and long-term implications that needs to be addressed at the international level.</p>','Pollution in the Developing World','<p>The 2015 Paris conference has been a rather isolated success in the realm of international coordination efforts regarding climate change and pollution. From Kyoto to Copenhagen, fundamental differences between the developed countries and the developing countries have prevented substantial efforts to improve air quality. At the core of these arguments lies a disagreement over how to view history; the developed countries point fingers at developing countries for their enormous carbon emissions, whereas the developing countries claim that pollution is a necessary part of industrialization, and that developed countries should be retroactively held accountable for their past pollution levels. There are arguments that pollution is inevitable in developing countries, which presents many challenges when attempting to discern the best course of action. Moreover, policymakers have little incentive to pass environmental regulations, since they attract little support. Laws that restrict pollution can be extremely costly without providing tangible benefits. Many are calling for a technological revolution to create more sustainable pollution levels. A dramatic reduction in pollution across borders will certainly require multilateral action from all developing countries, supported by developed countries.</p>','','','','','/static/docs/bg2016/ILMUNCIndia2016-WHO.png','/static/docs/bg2016/ILMUNCIndia2016-WHO.pdf',1385,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,'','Model UN has been a significant part of my life since freshman year of high school, and this weekend, without a doubt, has been the most rewarding experience thus far.

The ILO has made strides in significantly decreasing the actual number of children plagued by this harm. Yet many of the problems which contribute to childhood labor are ones that could be easily rectified by making structural changes in one\'s local environment. This topic will seek to uncover both short- and long-term ways to mitigate the problem of childhood labor, both on the local and international level. Drawing on the UN Convention on the Rights of a Child and many other international frameworks, it will be up to delegates to form cooperative, creative solutions to combat childhood labor and contribute to the achievement of several Millennium Development Goals.</p>','A Case Study: Gender Wage Gap in Latin America','<p>This topic will look at international standards and laws of women\'s rights and economic equality. This will allow delegates who are not representing Latin American countries to be able to build a position. For example, women\'s rights and human rights often get a poor reputation for being pushed on developing and non-super power countries by the US and allies. The background guide will set up discussion on issues of whether there should be a universal standard, how the global community can help with the gender gap in South America, and what solutions the international community can contribute to. It will then look at Latin America and compare policies in different countries. In the background guide, we will discuss various countries and current events that impact inequality. For example, a lot of information is available on Brazil, so that would definitely be something to cover. The goal of the background guide will be to set up a comparative background that allows delegates to understand the specific problems facing each country and other problems that are more regional. This will allow delegates to better understand the scope of the issue. We hope this will allow the debate to not only tackle issues facing Latin America in the present but also create a framework for continuing improvement going forward.</p>','','','','','/static/docs/bg2016/ILMUNCIndia2016-ILO.png','/static/docs/bg2016/ILMUNCIndia2016-ILO.pdf',1385,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,'','The executive board would like to sincerely thank delegates in the International Labor Organization for a truly unforgettable weekend.

At a more detailed level, those that are poor, vulnerable, and lack the resources to adapt are disproportionately affected, in many cases poor women who bear the responsibilities of food production and water collection in many parts of the world. UNFPA strives to promote sexual and reproductive health, education, and violence prevention to foster resilience among these vulnerable populations. \"Access to voluntary family planning, maternal health care and quality education are key ways to empower vulnerable women and young people, making them better equipped to prepare for and respond to climate-related crises.\"</p>','Child Marriage and Adolescent Pregnancy','<p>This first topic is a hybrid of some of the issues UNFPA addresses. While this may seem specific, the problems of child marriage and adolescent pregnancy call for reexamining traditional institutions of marriage and understanding how current laws reinforce inequality and problematic family structures. Child marriage and adolescent pregnancy are a both result of an absence of choices -- they are consequences of of access to education, information, and health care. Both child marriage and adolescent pregnancy drastically change the course of women\'s lives in terms of education, job prospects, and overall health. The UNFPA works to address this by supporting comprehensive health and sexuality education, and advocates for empowering women to return to school after pregnancy. The UNFPA also promotes legislation targeted towards ending child marriage, as well as evidence-based, women-centered initiatives that empower girls with the information and skills they need for a successful transition into adulthood. UNFPA also works to support the needs of married girls, particularly in family planning and maternal health.</p>','','','','','/static/docs/bg2016/ILMUNCIndia2016-UNFPA.png','/static/docs/bg2016/ILMUNCIndia2016-UNFPA.pdf',1385,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,'','Strange affinities for throwing away plastic bottles and organizing pencils aside, the UNFPA debated incredibly.

When I first heard the term, I was intrigued. As a student who despised mathematics, and who\'s forte was in Socials and English, it seemed like MUN was tailor made for me. Several mock sessions in my school motivated me to constantly urge myself to perform better, and my hard work and diligence finally payed off when the school selected as a part of a ten man delegation to represent our school at DNMUN back in 2015. I was shy, intimidated and unsure of myself. Now as I fast forward to the present, a good one and half years later, having attended several conferences in the Bangalore circuit, I realise the change that Model UN has brought about in me not just as a delegate, but also as a person. Not only has it helped me focus on academics by developing my mental capacity, it has also enabled me to be more comfortable while interacting with my peers. It has helped in shaping me to be the person I am today- Confident, Witty and Bold. As I am still in the 9th grade, my mentors and friends have been constantly telling me how I have a long road ahead and I truly look forward to enrich my experience on this road ahead by participating in one of the most reputed conferences aim India - ILMUNC\r\nI sincerely hope that the organising committee shall give me my allotment as they deem fit after evaluating my Model Revord which is as follows- \r\n1) Security Council, DNMUN 2015 (Turkey) - Special Mention\r\n2) General Assembly SOCHUM, DiPSMUN 2015 (Germany) -1st Commendable Delegate\r\n3) International Criminal Police Organisation, CoMUN 2015 (DPRK) - Special Mention\r\n4) Security Council, CGMUN 2015 (Syrian Arab Republic) -  2nd Honourable Delegate\r\n5) Futuristic Security Council, Amaatra MUN 2016 (France)- 1st Special Mention\r\n6) Security Council, DiPSMUN 2016 (Malaysia) - Best Delegate\r\n7) Security Council, SMUN 2016 (China) - 1st Commendable\r\n8) Security Council, SJPUCMUN 2016 (DPRK) - 1st Commendable\r\n9) Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, CJCMUN 2016 (Syria)- 2nd Honourable\r\n10) League of Nations, SJBHSMUN 2016 (South Africa) - Yet to attend\r\nPS: Note that all of these conferences were held in Bangalore\r\nThank you',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

                    <h4> Dear Delegates, </h4>
                    <p>Welcome to ILMUNC India 2015! My name is Janice Chung and I am delighted to be serving as your chair in Reconstructing Russia this year.</p> 
                    <p>To briefly introduce myself, I was born and raised in Hong Kong, spent six years at a Chinese primary school before switching to a German International School for high school. 
                        In high school, I was actively involved in the school’s rugby and basketball teams. Currently, I am a junior in the Wharton School here at Penn, 
                        majoring in Finance, Management and Operations and Information Management. When I’m not slaving away with my schoolwork, you can find me hanging 
                        out with the Community Outreach and Engagement crew in the International Affairs Association, where we work on a semester-long program with schools 
                        in the Philadelphia region. I’m also a tour guide for Penn Admissions, as well as a teacher for the Financial Literacy Community Project. </p>
                    <p> I’m thrilled to have you all in the Reconstructing Russia committee, and am excited to meet each and every one of you at the conference. Good luck with the preparation process – my crisis 
                        director, Alex, staffers and I look forward to hearing all about your ideas, and we hope to bring you an exciting and fulfilling weekend. See you all very soon!</p>
                    
                    <p>All the best, <br>

                    <h4> Dear Delegates, </h4>
                    <p>I couldn’t be more excited to welcome you to ILMUNC India! I’m Alex Kaplan, and I will be serving as your Crisis Director for the Reconstructing Russia committee! Janice and I have a great committee planned full of interesting crises and challenging topics. Get ready to have your crisis and debate skills tested!</p>
                    <p>First, a brief introduction. I am currently a rising sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences at Penn. I grew up in Northbrook, IL, a northern suburb of Chicago. At my high school, I competed in several MUN conferences, and my love of MUN has stayed with me while at Penn. In addition to ILMUNC India, I am also an Under Secretary-General for ILMUNC, the high school Model UN conference hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. I am currently planning on majoring in Economics and Political Science, with a possible minor in Mathematics. When I’m not in class or watching Netflix, I am also a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity and a deputy member of Penn Democrats. Also, if you’re a fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Game of Thrones, I’m your guy. </p>
                    <p>Delegates, I’m extremely excited to get started and witness your debate skills first hand! I greatly look forward to meeting you all; Reconstructing Russia is undoubtedly going to be the best committee at ILMUNC India this year! If you have any questions or just want to talk about the topic, please feel free to contact me!</p>
                    <p>See you all soon!<br>

                    <h4> Topic Summary </h4>
                <p>The year is 1991, and the states of the former Soviet Union currently face one of the 
                        greatest geopolitical reorganizations the modern world has yet seen. The 
                        disintegration of the Soviet Union has left the newly created Russian Federation’s 
                        economy in shambles, and Boris Yeltsin—Russia’s first directly elected 
                        President—will face many challenges in the coming months. From economic turmoil 
                        to political upheaval in the Russian Federation’s peripheral states, the Yeltsin 
                        administration is sure to have its hands full. As close advisors to President Yeltsin, 
                        your task this weekend will be to find solutions to the myriad of geopolitical and 
                        economic woes facing the Russian Federation, and to steer this struggling nation 
                        toward its former glory. Delegates, will you allow the failures of the previous regime 
                        restrain this new nation, or will you help realize the aspirations of our fledging 
                        federation?</p>

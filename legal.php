                    <h4> Dearest Delegates, </h4>
                    <p>Welcome to ILMUNC India, and most importantly, welcome to the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly! The United Nations, as an intergovernmental organization, addresses and reacts to issues that have global implications. Given the differing nature of legal systems worldwide, this committee holds a particularly meaningful purpose in considering the legal questions in the General Assembly. It is my distinct honor and pleasure to be your Chair for the Legal committee, and I cannot wait to see all of you present, debate, and merge your ideas.</p>
                    <p>A little bit about myself – I am a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences studying economics and mathematics. I was born in the technological hub (but actually just a serene suburb) of Cupertino, California and later moved to the ever-changing metropolitan of Shanghai, China, where I first became involved in Model UN. Though my academic background veers on the quantitative end, my interests in policy and international affairs have stayed with me throughout college. Other than competing as a delegate in high school and college, I have also served as Under-Secretary-General for our U.S. conference, ILMUNC, and Secretary-General for our China conference, ILMUNC China, so the opportunity to help create the ILMUNC experience in India as well is particularly exciting for me. When not doing Model UN, I am heavily involved with the Assembly of International Students, assist with Political Science research, and enjoy handing my life over to Google products.</p>
                    <p>Our two topics in this committee are “Diplomatic and Consular Mission Security” and “War Ethics of Drones,” both of which are highly relevant to our time. Substantively, successful delegates will have thoroughly researched their country’s positions and carefully formulated innovative ideas. Within committee, I hope to see you diplomatically advocate for your proposals and collaboratively reach your resolutions.</p>
                    <p>Warmest Regards <br>

                    <h4> Topic A: Diplomatic and Consular Mission Security </h4>
                    <p>Diplomatic and consular missions and representatives stand at the frontline of international relations, 

holding positions of unquestionable importance. However, this critical position also means that missions 

are highly vulnerable to targeted attacks as well as drastic changes within the foreign countries they are 

stationed in. While diplomatic laws codified in the Vienna Conventions serve to protect diplomatic and 

consular missions, recent transgressions suggest that further action or refinement of these codes may be 

necessary. This committee will identify some of the risks posed towards diplomatic and consular missions 

and discuss not only what measures should be put in place, but also whether such measures would be 

legal and necessary.</p>

                <div class="large-6 column justify">
                    <h4> Topic B: War Ethics of Drones </h4>
                    <p>The use of drones in current warfare is at the heart of controversy. For the entirety of human history, 

battlefields were filled with soldiers. Drones are slowly replacing them. As this committee will discuss 

drones in the context of war, it is important to note that drone deployment is shifting the definition of a 

battlefield and people’s conception of war. Delegates should also be prepared to discuss the ethical 

issues and legal questions that pertain to both drone operators and drone victims. Bear in mind, as well, 

that drones can serve as both lethal weapons and intelligence gatherers. While the relationship between 

ethics and law have long been debated, this committee will focus on the legal framework of real-life action 

and implications.</p>

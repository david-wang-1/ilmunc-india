	<h1>MUNCafe</h1>
	<p>Worldview is a person-centred experiential learning platform for students with an overriding focus on Transformative Leadership. We focus on what we believe is the most critical aspect of Leadership: Adaptive Capacity, the ability to adapt quickly to positively leverage the opportunities in fast changing environments. We strive to develop personal potential attributes in an individual which include Thinking &amp; Creativity, Knowledge, Communication skills, Ethics &amp; Integrity, Team Work, and Planning &amp; Organisation in order to improve this critical capacity in participants.</p>
	<p>We trigger this through a variety of carefully structured experiential learning programs which necessarily engage the students in working towards solutions for the challenges we face in our local &amp; global communities. We employ a blend of experiential learning tools such as Simulations, Travel, Case-studies, Projects &amp; Realtime work in order to create a dynamic out-of-classroom learning environment.</p>
	<p>MUNCafe, FutureSake and WILL are brands of Worldview.</p>

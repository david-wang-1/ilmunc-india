			<tbody class="expandable">
				<tr>
					<td><p>Model United Nations is a simulation of the UN General Assembly and other multilateral bodies. In Model UN, students step into the shoes of ambassadors from UN member states to debate current issues on the organization's agenda. While playing their roles as ambassadors, student "delegates" make speeches, prepare draft resolutions, negotiate with allies and adversaries, resolve conflicts, and navigate the Model UN conference rules of procedure - all in the interest of mobilizing international cooperation to resolve problems that affect countries all over the world.</p></td>

				</tr>

			<tbody class="expandable">
				<tr>
					<td><p>You do not require any experience to participate in general committees of most high school conferences like ILMUNC India! Although crisis committees warrant some experience as debate is not always linear, a good understanding of the committee's mandate is usually adequate for any student to participate effectively. For more information, please visit the sections on crisis committees and preparatory research. </p></td>

				<tr>
					<td>What types of topics are discussed in Model UN conferences?</td>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody class="expandable">
				<tr>
					<td><p>The agenda items discussed in committee vary at each conference. Most conferences tend to focus on current affairs issues that are being discussed in the United Nations. These issues can highlight political, financial and/or social concerns. However, the task of some committees might be to address hypothetical concerns or issues from the past or future. For example, at ILMUNC India, we have had numerous specialized and crisis committees including the Historical UN Commission on Human Rights (UNHRC) and Constellis &amp; Syrian Government, set in the year 2020.</p></td>

				</tr>

			<tbody class="expandable">
				<tr>
					<td><p>Model UN promotes students' and teachers' interest in the world around them and broadens a student's knowledge in a variety of subjects. Model UN also teaches vital skills in negotiation, public speaking, problem solving, conflict resolution, research and communication. At ILMUNC India, topics such as Emerging Technologies' Impact on Arms Trade allow students to gain deeper insight into and participate in an extremely current global discussion. It also gives students and teachers the opportunity to connect with their peers from across India, and from across the world, while also connecting with undergraduate students and representatives from global higher education institutions.</p></td>

					<td><p>For the first time, we are excited to announce that ILMUNC India will be a 100% residential conference. We wanted to ensure a holistic and immersive experience for our delegates while also ensuring the highest levels of safety. By staying at the hotel you are surrounded by delegates from numerous countries and cities from around the world. It is a great opportunity to network, make friends, and immerse yourself in this experience. Furthermore, ILMUNC India's social events tend to run a bit late into the night. We want our delegates to enjoy them in entirety and we do not believe it is fair for some delegations or delegates to miss out because they would need to travel home early. Finally, ILMUNC India may host special midnight crisis sessions, which are always exciting experiences, but is only possible when the conference is residential. We have worked hard to subsidize the accommodation and conference price for our delegates at one of the best 5 star hotels in Delhi. Model United Nations conferences such as ILMUNC are more than just committee simulations. Delegates learn from and enjoy their out of committee experience just as much as their committee one. We would be happy to talk further if you may have concerns about the nature of the conference. However, we are certain that this is the best way to make the most out of your ILMUNC India experience</p></td>

At ILMUNC India, we are also excited to announce the use of dynamic background guides - these will be an online interactive supplement to the traditional background guide, where we will have discussion forums, where you can interact with your Chairs and Directors, and where you can read relevant articles that will be regularly posted. You will receive information on how to access your background guide and dynamic background guide once you have been allocated to a committee and been assigned a country or position. Depending on your prior experience, do read through our guidelines regarding rules of procedure, writing resolutions, working papers, and position papers. Also familiarize yourself with the key points from our training videos, which will be updated regularly closer to the date of the conference. To research more comprehensively, you can also look through our compiled research links to find resources pertinent to your committee, country, and topic.</p></td>

Regardless, if you are required to write a position paper for your committee, you will have adequate time prior to the conference, and there will be a lot of resources to guide you in the writing process.

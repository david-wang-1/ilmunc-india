Clothes that expose excessive bare skin or are otherwise revealing are deemed inappropriate.</li>
		<li>
			All delegates are expected to remain "in character" while at ILMUNC India by consistently advocating the interests and representing the policies of the country assigned.

			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			All faculty advisors are responsible for the safety, wellbeing, and conduct of their delegates.
			<ol type="a">
				<li>The educational quality of ILMUNC India is primarily dependent on all delegates' active and professional participation. Faculty advisors can ensure this by monitoring their student's attendance at committee sessions and helping them understand the skills of diplomacy as practiced at ILMUNC India.</li>
				<li>During the conference, faculty advisors are encouraged to attend faculty advisor meetings and feedback sessions, to observe their students from the back of committee rooms, and even to advise students on substantive issues. However, participation in the committee process must be left to the delegates and the ILMUNC India staff. Faculty advisors may not participate in the writing of resolutions or in caucusing Ivy League Model United Nations Conference India 2017 Terms and Conditions activities or otherwise engage in the committee process.</li>
				<li>Faculty advisors are required to assist the ILMUNC India staff in enforcing Security Policies, Dress Code, and the ILMUNC India terms and conditions with regards to their school's delegates.

Country assignments will be issued on a rolling basis, dependent on receiving payment of at least 50% of the delegation's total fees for ILMUNC India.

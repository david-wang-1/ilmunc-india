		<li>
			All delegates are expected to remain "in character" while at ILMUNC India by consistently advocating the interests and representing the policies of the country assigned.

			All faculty advisors are responsible for the safety, wellbeing, and conduct of their delegates.
			<ol type="a">

Faculty advisors can ensure this by monitoring their student's attendance at committee sessions and helping them understand the skills of diplomacy as practiced at ILMUNC India.</li>
				<li>During the conference, faculty advisors are encouraged to attend faculty advisor meetings and feedback sessions, to observe their students from the back of committee rooms, and even to advise students on substantive issues. However, participation in the committee process must be left to the delegates and the ILMUNC India staff.

		<li>All delegations are responsible for paying for and filling all slots assigned through our country assignment process.</li>
		<li>All delegations registered by our priority deadline of August 30, 2017, will be given preference for country assignments. Country assignments will be issued on a rolling basis, dependent on receiving payment of at least 50% of the delegation's total fees for ILMUNC India.

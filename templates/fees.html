	<h2>Registration Policies</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			There will be two rounds of registrations:

				<li>Regular registrations will take place from August 31st to October 30th.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Priority allocations will occur at the end of August. Although we do our best to keep everyone's preferences in mind while allocating, earlier registrations are more likely to be assigned their country preferences.</li>

			Allocations will not be released until the relevant materials have been received and processed for each member of a delegation. If any of the materials below are not received, you will be pushed into a later allocation round.

                    <h4> Dear Delegates, </h4>
                    <p>Welcome to ILMUNC India! My name is Roy Lan and I will have the distinct honor of serving as your chair in DISEC this year. This is my first year serving as a part of senior staff for ILMUNC India and I would like to take a few moments to introduce myself before delving into the substance of our debate. </p>
                    <p>I went to elementary school in Birmingham, Alabama, moved to Memphis, Tennessee in the fourth grade, and have stayed there ever since. I’m currently a junior in the Vagelos Program for the Molecular Life Sciences, which is a four-year Bachelor’s—Master’s degree program where I’ll be majoring in Biochemistry, minoring in Health Care Management, and earning a Master’s in Chemistry. In the future, I want to be a health systems manager, or a health policy maker within the United States.</p>
                    <p>I grew up an avid cross country runner and played basketball for all of my high school teams. You can find me around campus in a multitude of groups. I’m involved in FIMRC, a global nonprofit that raises money for Diabetes awareness in Nicaragua through volunteer work at the local Penn Transplant House and Ronald McDonald House. I’m also a research assistant for Dr. Simon, the scientific director of the Abramson Cancer Institute here at Penn. I also established Penn’s first in-person peer counseling group—Penn Benjamins. As for Model UN, I started as a freshman in high school as a delegate for one year, and subsequently began chairing committees/organizing conferences my next three high school years. </p>
                    <p>As for the committee and the conference in general, I very much look forward to meeting each and every one of y’all in the time that we have together. I know that my fellow chairs and staffers will be dedicating a lot of time in order to ensure a smooth and professional committee for all. I encourage each and every one of you not only to be diligent in your research and your professionalism during the conference, but most importantly enjoy your time here in the company of many other talented, thoughtful, and amazing people. </p>
                    <p>I look forward to meeting everyone very soon, and cannot wait to begin committee!</p>
                    <p>All the Best, <br>

                    <h4> Topic A: Fourth Generation Warfare in the Middle East </h4>
                    <p>First coined in 1989 by American author William Lind, fourth generation

warfare is a constantly changing concept. Most consider it to involve political 

influences, dispersed widely, and an increasing use of technology. Delegates should 

seek to discuss the many challenges that member states face as this new generation 

of warfare descends upon the Middle East in particular. The faster pace, coupled 

with increasingly advanced technologies will prove difficult for many nations to 

adapt to and ultimately combat. However, in order to promote a more just, 

prosperous world, adaptations must take place. The delegates must propose and 

ultimately establish a precedent to be used for years to come on how to best define 

and interact with fourth generation warfare within the Middle East.</p>

                    <h4> Topic B: Emerging Technologies' Impact on Arms Trade </h4>
                    <p>The increasing sophistication, coupled with the exponentially rising rate of 

change of emerging technologies in the arms trade poses a significant problem to 

the United Nations. The rapid development of new warfare techniques and 

technologies such as aerial drones, new explosives, and cyber attacks, directly 

opposes the promotion of a more prosperous, peaceful world. Indeed, the very 

classification of weapons may need to be revisited due to the rapidly shifting nature 

of warfare. Thus, it is imperative that these new emerging technologies not only are 

discussed within committee, but a comprehensive plan be formulated with the input 

of member states of all directives. Without such precedent, countless lives may be in 

imminent danger, while the pursuit of peace may be meaningfully threatened.</p>

                    <h4> Dear Delegates, </h4>
                    <p>It is a tremendous honor and privilege to welcome you to ILMUNC India. My name is Kent Hutchison, and I will be serving as your Chair for Constellis and Syrian Government, 2020. I am extraordinarily excited to chair this unique committee, which is sure to both entertain and challenge you throughout the course of the conference.
                    <p>Born and raised in the small semi-rural village of Clarendon Hills, outside of Chicago, I recently traveled from my humble Midwestern roots all the way to the East Coast, and specifically the University of Pennsylvania. I am a sophomore in the Wharton School planning to concentrate in Finance, Global Analysis, and whatever else Leonardo DiCaprio studied before The Wolf of Wall Street. Model UN is a passion of mine–I have had the privilege of traveling around the world to compete at international conferences, as well as at many domestic conferences, where I have made incredible friends and shared many memorable moments. I currently serve as an Under-Secretary-General for Crisis Committees at the University of Pennsylvania Model United Nations Conference, and also compete with Penn’s traveling Intercollegiate team. My hobbies outside of Model UN include writing, playing basketball, and competitive birdwatching.</p>
                    <p>Should you choose to become a part of Constellis and Syrian Government, 2020, you will be instantly immersed in a responsive and fast-paced crisis environment. This committee not only represents a potential future scenario for Middle Eastern geopolitics, but also an entirely new paradigm in international relations: a not-so-distant future in which the United States’ appetite for war has reached rock bottom. I, alongside your dutiful crisis staff, will work tirelessly to implement the course of action decided upon by the committee–but be prepared for a few surprises along the way. </p>
                    <p>I cannot wait to meet each and every one of you at ILMUNC India. Best of luck in preparations, and please feel free to reach out to me with any questions whatsoever!</p>
                    <p>Yours in Diplomacy <br>

                    <h4> Dear Delegates, </h4>
                    <p>Hello delegates and welcome to ILMUNC India! My name is Kishan Patel and it is my pleasure to serve as your Crisis Director in "Constellis Syrain Government 2020" this year. I'm extremely excited to be a part of this committee, as it presents a both challenging and exciting experience for everyone.</p>

<p>Born in New York City, I moved to Connecticut in the fourth grade, and lived there until I left for Penn. I'm currently a Senior in Wharton and the College of Arts and Sciences, studying Finance and Political Science. Last summer, I worked in investment banking in New York and am looking forward to continuing in that field after graduation. While I'm unsure what my longer-term plans are, I'm hoping to get more involved in international relations related fields.   In high school, I played tennis as much as possible but since coming to Penn, I&rsquo;ve changed gears somewhat. Around campus, I&rsquo;m involved in the International Affairs Association and compete as a crisis delegate for the competitive team. In addition I&rsquo;m also on the Wharton Undergraduate Research Board, a group committed to fostering a research community and bridging the gap between the faculty and undergraduate research opportunities. I&rsquo;m also a Joseph Wharton Scholar and will conduct a business related research project this year. Currently, I&rsquo;m planning on looking at Chinese monetary policy and its potential implications for the global financial system with the US Dollar as the reserve currency of the world.</p>

<p>In terms of conference and committee, Kent and I are really looking forward to meeting all of you in the fall. I greatly enjoy the conferences Penn runs in Philadelphia, and I'm looking forward to building memories in India come November. Both Kent and I expect each and every one of you to be informed, professional, and proactive during the conference. More importantly though, we really want you to enjoy yourselves and have a memorable conference where you make connections that last for years to come.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to either me or Kent. We would be more than happy to talk and get to know you. See everyone in the fall!</p>
                    <p>Best Regards <br>

                    <h4> Topic Summary </h4>
                    <p>The year is 2020, and America, having lost its appetite for battle amidst massive anti-war protests, has contracted out the defense of liberty. Desperate to finally bring stability to the Middle East, the US has replaced all military personnel in Syria with the private security corporation Constellis Holdings, a defense contractor composed of companies formerly known as independent agencies Blackwater, Triple Canopy, and Tidewater Global Services. Constellis is tasked with engaging and ultimately defeating the Bashar al-Assad regime, still in power despite enduring massive casualties in what has become a full-scale civil war. This committee will consider the tactical components of a modern-day military campaign from the unique perspective of a private corporation very much susceptible to the leverage of public opinion on its operations. For the Assad regime, this committee will provide the opportunity to deal a devastating blow to America's geopolitical priorities while effectively -- and permanently -- consolidating domestic political control.</p>

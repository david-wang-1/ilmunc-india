                    <h4> Dear Delegates, </h4>
                    <p>It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the 3rd session of the Ivy League Model United Nations Conference India. My name is Dhrupad Bhardwaj and I’m excited to be the Chair for the Security Council at ILMUNC India 2015. Historically one of the most influential, controversial, politicised and powerful committees at the United Nations, the Security Council has traditionally been the committee for the best and brightest delegates and ILMUNC India 2015 will be no exception. </p>
                    <p>But before we dive in and talk about the committee, a bit about myself. I’m currently a rising senior in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I’ve been doing Model UN since my sophomore year of high school and I’ve loved every moment since. At Penn, I had the distinct honour of starting ILMUNC India and I have the pleasure of returning as a chair for my last year in college. I also work on tech for the IAA, updating and improving its web presence and information management systems. And when I’m not being a tech geek I do also compete on the circuit, one of my favourite passions outside my majors. Apart from Model UN, I love cooking and bartending; I’m a classically trained Pianist and an avid supporter of Chelsea Football Club.</p>
 
                    <p>The last few years have been extremely turbulent in the international geopolitical environment. Crimea, Ukraine, Syria, Iran and North Korea have all been grounds tension between the two traditional power blocs – United States and Russia. Additionally with the rise of a third superpower China, the Security Council has truly been a hotpot of divergent international relation policies as well as diplomatic posturing.</p>
 
                    <p>One aspect which makes the Security Council an especially interesting Model UN committee is that the topics for discussion are extremely     sensitive to the prevailing geo-political climate at the time and thus any delegate must not only have an excellent understanding of foreign policy as well as objectives of each nation present, but also be able to predict how actions by individual nations or groups such as NATO would affect the trajectory of the committee over the course of three days of debate.</p>
 
                    <p>To succeed, I encourage you to research and truly understand your nation’s policy as well be cognizant long-term objectives of the P5. Unlike a normal committee, I expect delegates to adhere to foreign policy while devising ways to best further the interests of their nations. Leading up to conference feel free reach out to your Chief of Staff Ana Rancic as well as myself with any questions or concerns and we will do our best to make this the best ILMUNC India yet!</p>

                    <p> See you in November!</p>

                    <p>Best Regards <br>

                    <h4> Topic A: Limiting Military Intervention in sensitive Geo-Political Countries </h4>
                    <p> One of the biggest shortfalls of the Security Council in recent times has been it’s inability to limit unwarranted intervention in countries with sensitive internal situations. A majority of such intervention is led by militarily superior nations - most traditionally the two ’superpowers' : United States and Russia. 
On the other hand, the Security Council has also often been used as a means of legitimizing intervention when it wasn’t necessary. The objective of this committee is to ensure that the Security Council remains the chief UN body to advocate and sanction military action as and when required and effectively restricts unilateral campaigns.</p></div>
                <div class="large-6 column justify">
                    <h4> Topic B:  Reforms of the United Nations Security Council </h4>
                    <p> Security Council reform is a debate that has been extensively been discussed by world leaders and media alike. encompassing five major issues: category of membership, veto power , regional representation, expanded membership, and the relationship with the General Assembly, this debate has been drawn out for decades. However, the Security Council has yet to deliver a strong stance regarding reforms  The idea is to explore the entire dynamics of such reforms - whether or not new members be added to the existing p5, the parity and necessity of veto power, the workings of a larger Security Council and more!  </p></div>

                    <h4> Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisors, </h4>
                    <p>Welcome to the third Ivy League Model United Nations Conference in India! My name is Ahmed Kamil and it is my pleasure to serve as the chair of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. As it is the first time UNODC will be offered as a committee at ILMUNC India, I am eager to see how fresh topics translate into intense and stimulating debate.</p>

                    <p>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania and an Arabic target in the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business, hoping to concentrate in Finance and Statistics and minor in Mathematics. I was born in Khartoum, Sudan on a warm summer day and immigrated to the United States when I was about two years old. Since then, I have lived in Greenbelt, Maryland. I first got involved with Model United Nations my freshman year, participated throughout high school, and am now a member of Pennâ€™s International Affairs Association, serving as the Director of Operations for UPMUNC XLIX, the legendary college counterpart to the equally awesome ILMUNC. Some of my other interests include longboarding, Hip-Hop, Classical Arabic, and drinking coffee without sugar. </p>

                    <p>The UNODC operates globally through a network of field offices, leading the effort to fight transnational crime, the exchange of illicit drugs, and international terrorism. This committee is distinguished by several themes and objectives that are carried out through three main functions: research, guidance, and the provision of logistical assistance. Provided with an interesting combination of member states, goals, and courses of actions, committee sessions and resolutions should be characterized by creativity and cooperation. I encourage you all to consider these factors during your research and, in turn, outline actionable ideas and propositions to bring to committee in November. </p>

                    <p>In the months leading up to conference, please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions regarding ILMUNC India or Penn. I look forward to meeting everyone in the fall!</p>
                    <p>Best Regards <br>

                    <h4> Topic A: Drug Cartel </h4>
                    <p>Drug cartels have been leading anti-drug trafficking organizations on an expensive game of cat 

and mouse since the 1970s. Employing multiple operations, including production, money laundering, and arm supplying, while also developing connections
. While the clashes that occur between 

law enforcement agencies and cartels are significant, the skirmishes that occur between rival 

cartels entangle countless innocent lives. To further complicate the global situation, vigilante 

militias composed of dissatisfied community members are becoming a more frequent response 

to drug cartels, leaving governments with yet another element to consider in minimizing 

casualties. Although many member states are not home to drug cartels, the ramifications of 

drug trafficking affect every country whether it is in the early step of production or the final step 

of consumption. The United Nations shall serve as a channel through which member nations 

can articulate individual concerns with the ultimate objective of centralizing efforts to end the 

operations of drug cartels.</p></div>
                <div class="large-6 column justify">
                    <h4> Topic B: Police Response to Violence </h4>
                    <p>Within the past decade, accounts of police brutality in response to violence and civil unrest have 

served as headlining stories. Although these reports are especially common in the United States 

and South Africa, cases of excessive force are prevalent throughout the world, ranging from 

areas such as the liberal European Union to the conservative Middle East. The situation is 

exacerbated by the rampant corruption and lack of transparency present in both developed and 

undeveloped countries alike, leaving citizens with a general sense of insecurity over their rights. 

However, the concern of human rights abuse is not a one-way street. The question arises as to 

what extent police can carry out their duties and when carrying out these duties becomes a 

matter of self-defense rather than an occupation. Essentially, delegates must take on the taxing 

task of balancing protecting the rights of civilians with preventing the endangerment of law 

enforcement officers. Because this topic is complex and far reaching in its implications, member 

nations play a significant part in generating resolutions and have the opportunity to adopt a 

myriad of policies.</p></div>
